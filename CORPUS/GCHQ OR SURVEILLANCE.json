        "body": "The director of GCHQ, Robert Hannigan, is to stand down early for personal reasons, mainly health issues involving his wife and other family members. Hannigan only took over at the UK\u2019s surveillance agency in November 2014 to oversee a more open approach after revelations by the National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden put GCHQ on the defensive in 2013. His sudden resignation \u2013 he informed staff just hours before making this decision public \u2013 prompted speculation that it might be related to British concerns over shared intelligence with the US in the wake of Donald Trump becoming president. But the GCHQ press release stressed his decision was exclusively for family reasons. As well as his ill wife, Hannigan has two elderly parents to look after. He will remain in post until a successor is appointed.\nIn a press statement, he said: \u201cI have been lucky enough to have some extraordinary roles in public service over the last 20 years, from Northern Ireland to No 10, the Cabinet Office and the Foreign Office. But they have all demanded a great deal of my ever patient and understanding family and now is the right time for a change in direction.\u201d Applications will be invited from within GCHQ and elsewhere in government. The salary last year was between \u00a3160,00 and \u00a3165,000. At GCHQ, Hannigan had led a push to make the agency more transparent, a process that included a major speech in the US last year on encryption and tech companies. He also pressed to try to put GCHQ at the forefront of digital challenges, leading to the creation of the National Cyber Security Centre in October last year. In his resignation letter to the Foreign Office, which is responsible for both GCHQ and the Secret Intelligence Service, better known as MI6, Hannigan said: \u201cAs you know, I have also initiated the greatest internal change within GCHQ for 30 years, and I feel that we are now well on the way to being fit for the next generation of security challenges to the UK in the digital age. \u201cAfter a good deal of thought I have decided that this is the right time to move on and to allow someone else to lead GCHQ through its next phase.\u201d The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, replied praising Hannigan for setting the groundwork for a major transformation of cyber defences. Hannigan\u2019s background was not initially in intelligence. Born in Gloucester in 1965 and brought up in Yorkshire, he had been a high-flying civil servant at the Northern Ireland Office, where he was head of communications and later political director. He was involved in the peace process, credited with coming up with the idea for a diamond-shaped table in order to get over objections by the opposing sides about seating arrangements. He transferred to London where he became involved in a series of intelligence jobs, including defence and liaison with the US, before going on to GCHQ, where he worked for six months as part of the handover before taking control. At the time, GCHQ, in spite of many of its secrets spilled by Snowden, remained the most secretive of the three intelligence agencies: the others being MI6 and MI5. But Hannigan expanded the press team, invited more journalists to visit GCHQ and encouraged a stream of news stories aimed at bringing the agency into the public eye. In his first week in office, he created controversy with a column published in the Financial Times accusing US technology companies of becoming \u201cthe command and control networks of choice\u201d for terrorists. In March last year, he softened his criticism in a speech to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, calling for a new relationship between the intelligence agencies and the tech companies, part of a campaign to try to secure the help of the companies in providing access to supposedly encrypted messages. It is understood that the explanation for his sudden departure was reinforced in an internal message to GCHQ staff, acknowledging that many members faced enormous personal pressures and that he had opted to make his family his priority.\n",

        "body": "Many words about GCHQ have appeared over the last two years \u2013 but rarely have they been GCHQ\u2019s own words. We welcome the debate now under way in parliament and among the public about our work. We need public consent for what we do \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t want to do our jobs without it. We want the debate to be informed by facts, not half-understood inferences. We do not expect to persuade everyone to support what we do, but GCHQ certainly does bear a responsibility to make sure the discussion about us is based in reality. I want to cover two particular topics frequently misunderstood: bulk interception and encryption. The draft bill published on Wednesday responds to three independent reviews carried out into investigatory powers. The reviews were unanimous in their agreement that the powers currently available to the intelligence and security services remain essential. And while the courts have recently confirmed that the bulk interception regime was lawful, the reviewers concluded that the legal framework needed updating. We are confident that the draft bill places our powers on a clearer footing and strengthens safeguards and oversight to a world-leading standard. The draft bill also enables GCHQ and our sister agencies to meet the challenges of technological advances. As the internet grows exponentially, and smartphones create an explosion in information, increasingly tech-savvy criminals and terrorists attempt to hide in the mass of data and the dark recesses of the web. Our best \u2013 often our only \u2013 chance to detect them is to search and analyse datasets in which they might be found. All major UK counter-terrorism investigations of the last decade have relied on analysis of data collected at scale to understand and disrupt the threat. This is particularly critical when a threat emanates from overseas, where we and other agencies have fewer options to illuminate it. Many other aspects of our work depend on it too, including child exploitation, cybersecurity and serious crime. In 2014, GCHQ analysis of bulk data uncovered a previously unknown individual in contact with Isis attack-planners in Syria. Although he tried to hide his activity, we were able to use bulk data to spot that he had travelled to Europe, where he planned to carry out an attack. The data was provided to the authorities in that country, enabling the successful disruption of the plot, including capturing the home-made bombs he had manufactured. Use of these bulk data powers is not indiscriminate. GCHQ cannot and would not hoover up every piece of information. It would be illegal for us to carry out \u201cmass surveillance\u201d, nor would we want to, even if the law allowed it. And stringent access controls apply before analysts may examine any particular piece of data. We always focus on maximising the probability of identifying people who wish to do us harm. The scale of internet data is staggering compared to 10 years ago, so while the volume we scan may seem large, it is a minute slice of the whole. Those with unfettered access to our operations have quickly dispelled the mass surveillance myth. David Anderson QC examined examples of cases reliant on bulk interception, interrogated our analysts and looked at our intelligence reports. He wrote: \u201cThey leave me in not the slightest doubt that bulk interception, as it is currently practised, has a valuable role to play in protecting national security.\u201d The parliamentary intelligence and security committee stated: \u201cOur inquiry has shown that the agencies do not have the legal authority, the resources, the technical capability, or the desire to intercept the communications of British citizens, or of the internet as a whole. GCHQ is not reading the emails of everyone in the UK.\u201d Sir Anthony May, one of Britain\u2019s most senior judges, conducted an investigation and asked the question whether we engage in random mass intrusion into the private affairs of innocent citizens. His answer was \u201cemphatically no\u201d. There is another myth that badly needs busting, namely the idea that GCHQ is against encryption and would not disclose vulnerabilities in software. We live more and more of our lives online and it is right that companies which hold the personal data of their customers take the strongest steps to keep it secure. It is also right that people should be able to interact with their bank and other businesses with confidence. As well as being civil servants charged with a unique mission, our own staff live everyday lives where they, their family and their friends depend on the same secure technology as everyone else. The draft bill essentially repeats what the law currently says about encryption. We do not seek to ban encryption, we do not want mandatory \u201cback doors\u201d in products and we frequently warn companies about security vulnerabilities we find. On a daily basis we advise companies and public services about how to deal with specific cyber-attacks. No organisation does more to protect UK cybersecurity than GCHQ. In September 2015, Apple publicly credited CESG (the information assurance arm of GCHQ) with the detection of a vulnerability in its iOS operating system for iPhones and iPads which could have been exploited. That vulnerability has now been patched. Dealing with encryption and analysing data at scale were crucial for GCHQ\u2019s predecessors at Bletchley Park to succeed in their mission. Protecting life and liberty is our heritage, but it\u2019s our current and future duty too. We need legislation and powers fit for the modern world to carry out that duty.\n",

        "body": "It was an unusual group. An investigative journalist, a moral philosopher, an internet entrepreneur, a cyber-law academic, a government historian, a computer scientist, a technology exec, a long-time cop, an ex-minister and three former heads of intelligence agencies. I wondered not just how but if we could agree on anything, let alone an entire set of recommendations to reform UK communications surveillance. Yet we did. The Royal United Services Institute panel was set up by Nick Clegg, the then deputy prime minister, in response to revelations from the US whistleblower Edward Snowden about the scale of intrusion by US and British intelligence agencies into private lives. Our remit: to look at the legality, effectiveness and privacy implications of government surveillance; how it might be reformed; and how intelligence gathering could maintain its capabilities in the digital age.\nIt wasn\u2019t easy and there were several times when I thought I would be writing a minority report with one or two of the panel members. But in the end we reached consensus: the report \u2013 published today \u2013 proposes that the security services continue with bulk collection of communications data, but with improved oversight and safeguards. It wasn\u2019t the ideal any of us individually might have chosen, but neither does it contain items any of us heartily oppose. For me there were four main victories and one loss. At what point is privacy engaged? For the security services and government it only becomes an issue at the point when a human looks at material. This is how vast quantities of data could be intercepted, stored and analysed by computer without much considering of privacy implications. For me privacy is engaged from the moment information is accessed and stored. Take the recent case of Amnesty International\u2019s emails being found on GCHQ computers. Does it matter whether or not they were actually read by a person? The mere fact they were intercepted and stored by an intelligence agency is worrying enough. In bulk collection the potential exists for anyone to be watched at any time. One of the red herrings put our way was that GCHQ does not conduct mass surveillance because it does not read everyone\u2019s email. What was not mentioned is that GCHQ might intercept and store large quantities of it, as the Amnesty case demonstrates.\nThe point of Jeremy Bentham\u2019s Panopticon wasn\u2019t that everyone was actually watched at all times, it was that they could all potentially be watched. It is the possibility of omnipotent surveillance that acts as a chilling effect on any behaviour that potentially offends the state or the powers that be. For those who commit acts of journalism or legal advocacy that directly challenge state power, the risks in such a society are great. This is why the report states that privacy is engaged at point of collection and recommends regular review of data retention policies by oversight bodies to ensure they remain proportionate. Another partial win is changing the way surveillance is authorised. I went on to the panel with a clear goal to shift the system away from authorisation of surveillance by politicians to a more independent judicial system. Most democratic countries abolished political warrants for the reason that political expediency should not override the constraints of the law. And judicial warrants are more likely to gain cooperation from US internet companies. After all, the US stopped letting politicians sign off intrusive warrants in 1789 with the fourth amendment. The spies and politicians initially wanted no change to the current regime. However the recommendation by David Anderson QC on judicial warrants made it much harder to stick with the status quo. Even so, the majority of panellists opted for a compromise: a largely judicial authorisation system but with the secretary of state signing warrants for national security and economic wellbeing, but subject to judicial review. The third point may seem innocuous: a recommendation that the commissioners be given a statutory right to refer cases to the investigatory powers tribunal. The IPT is the only \u201ccourt\u201d where people can seek legal redress against improper surveillance. Yet obtaining evidence to bring a case to court is almost impossible. Groups such as Privacy International, Liberty and Amnesty are reliant on either a whistleblower like Snowden or pure speculative guesswork. The commissioners are the only outsiders allowed to see the inner workings of intelligence gatherers, yet they face prohibitions on disclosure so cannot bring the fullness of their findings into the public domain, nor refer them to the IPT. Finally, there is a subtle shift away from the \u201cclean bill of health\u201d given to past and current surveillance practices. This was very contested. A good deal of assumptions were made that, in my view, gave the benefit of the doubt to those whom we were supposed to be investigating. The intelligence and security committee report gives conclusive assurances that nothing the intelligence agencies have done is illegal or wrong.\nI, and one or two others, did not feel we had seen enough evidence or knew enough about the activities to give such an assurance. How can we endorse what has not been avowed? The activities we did know about may not be technically illegal (though it is a question still before the courts), but they were done without public knowledge or a public mandate. To use such vast and intrusive powers without a public mandate is more worthy of sanction than endorsement in my opinion. At the very least, past activities show a clear failure to respect the democratic process. Not surprisingly, I encountered most resistance when pushing for detailed information about what the agencies are actually doing. Are they using personal data from other parts of the government such as the NHS to build algorithms to predict future criminals? I don\u2019t know. But if we are to be an informed citizenry \u2013 a prerequisite in a democracy \u2013 we need the agencies to avow their most intrusive un-targeted surveillance practices. Otherwise, they do not have a public mandate for them. In effect, they are acting outside the democratic system. It was also impossible to make judgments about the effectiveness of bulk surveillance techniques because the underlying data is available only to those with a stake in promoting its effectiveness, rather like granting a pharmaceutical company with a drug to sell total secrecy over its clinical trials. The best we could do was this: \u201cIt is unrealistic for the intelligence agencies and some specialist parts of the police service to operate in very transparent ways. They could not be effective if they did. They should, however, be rigorously and independently held accountable, and the oversight mechanisms must themselves be highly transparent to the public.\u201d \u2022 Heather Brooke, a professor of journalism, was a member of the RUSI independent surveillance review panel \u2022 This article was amended on 14 July 2015. An earlier version said David Anderson\u2019s report gave conclusive assurances that nothing the intelligence agencies had done was illegal or wrong. That is not the case.\n",

        "body": "A former GCHQ whistleblower has condemned plans by government lawyers to increase prison sentences and expand the definition of espionage for the digital age. Katharine Gun, a former translator for the monitoring agency who leaked details of an operation to bug United Nations offices before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, has spoken out following the publication of Law Commission plans suggesting that maximum jail terms for those leaking information should rise from two years to 14 years. In the past, Gun has called for a public interest defence to be introduced into the Official Secrets Act (OSA) to protect whistleblowers and prevent governments from hiding politically embarrassing information.\nShe said: \u201cThe Official Secrets Act 1989 may need reforming for the digital era, but I would argue that at its heart there should be protection for whistleblowers. As it stands, the OSA is reputedly one of the most draconian secrecy laws in the world. It seems to me to have been very effective at dissuading and preventing the 99.9% of British citizens who have signed to it from making unauthorised disclosures. \u201cOn the rare occasions where it has been breached, it could be argued that it was done to expose lies or misrepresentations of the truth and other forms of skulduggery. Examples include Clive Ponting, Peter Wright, David Shayler, myself, David Keogh and Leo O\u2019Connor. Peter Wright\u2019s case followed the publication of his book, Spycatcher, Lord Goff [a judge] said at the time, \u2018In a free society, there is a continuing public interest that the workings of government should be open to scrutiny and criticism.\u2019 \u201cIt seems to me that we are living in an increasingly unfree society. The government and its intelligence and security apparatus have amassed ever broader and deeper powers through legislation like the Justice and Security Act 2013 and the Investigatory Powers Act 2016. These laws enable it to survey all private communications and online activity, carry out bulk collection and storage of data, hack private devices, detain and interrogate at whim and demand CMP [closed material procedures] in court, preventing evidence and information from being disclosed in the interest of national security.\n\u201cIf the proposals to reform or rewrite the OSA extend the overall dragnet nature of the act, increase the penalty limit and disregard a public interest defence, it will exacerbate the concentration of power in the hands of the government and deter or even prevent whistleblowers from revealing government lies and abuse of power.\u201d Gun was charged under the OSA in 2003, but the prosecution was dropped when it came to court the following year amid speculation that there would have been a political outcry. Referring to the request in 2003 from the US National Security Agency to bug the offices of countries on the UN security council before the vote on invading Iraq, Gun said: \u201cI was enraged by the subterfuge and potential blackmail they wanted us to carry out. I went public and it was published in the Observer.\u201d Commenting on the Law Commission proposals, the the Liberal Democrat peer and civil liberties campaigner Paul Strasburger said:\u201cThis attempt to suppress dissent and prevent the public knowing the truth is typical of Mrs May\u2019s time at the home office. She has carried the same authoritarian approach into Brexit by doing everything she can to limit debate and keep voters in the dark. \u201cThese proposals might be appropriate for a banana-republic dictatorship. They are completely out of the question in our democracy which depends on brave whistleblowers and a free press to hold the government to account when they let us down through incompetence or corruption. \u201cLiberal Democrats will strongly resist these extremely dangerous proposals.\u201d\nMartha Spurrier, director of Liberty, said: \u201cIt\u2019s disturbing that the Law Commission considers a single meeting adequate consultation to inform such drastic and dangerous proposals. We don\u2019t \u2013 and we will be submitting a thorough response to the public consultation. \u201cThese oppressive plans have no place in a democracy. They would skew the balance even further in favour of state secrecy, irrespective of potentially profound public interest. By increasing the prospect of prosecutions for revelations that are merely embarrassing or inconvenient, they would silence whistle-blowers and gag our press. \u201cThis is the latest hypocritical move from a government intent on operating in the shadows while monitoring every move the rest of us make. When the agencies\u2019 illegal mass surveillance was exposed by Snowden\u2019s courageous actions, this government responded with the eye-wateringly authoritarian investigatory powers act. That law makes it illegal to disclose even the mere existence of warrants to intercept people\u2019s communications, meaning those who are unlawfully spied on, including journalists, will never know about it \u2013 unless whistle-blowers come forward.\u201d The National Union of Journalists said it would robustly defend the rights of its members. Michelle Stanistreet, NUJ general secretary, said: \u201cThe ramifications of these recommendations are huge for journalists and freedom of the press. Journalists face being criminalised for simply doing their job and the public\u2019s right to know will be severely curtailed by these proposals. The union will respond robustly to the Law Commission\u2019s consultation on changes to the Official Secrets Act.\u201d She said: \u201cIt was the present prime minister Theresa May who was the \u2018Big Sister\u2019 and original architect of the snoopers\u2019 charter. We need to protect the public from a government which seems intent on threatening journalists from finding information the government finds inconvenient to be exposed. Democracy is under attack when a government does all it can to do its business in secret.\u201d\n",

        "body": "Queensland police will not examine the legality of a local council\u2019s audio surveillance scheme, despite concerns the recordings could breach privacy laws and be inadmissible in court. Moreton Bay regional council last week switched on microphones on more than 330 CCTV cameras to record public conversations, citing the need to provide police with audio to accompany footage requested for criminal investigations. The roll out of what is believed to be the first local government-run audio surveillance scheme in Australia has prompted an investigation by the state\u2019s privacy commissioner, who suspects it could be unlawful. The commissioner, Phil Green, who has rejected claims he approved the scheme, is reviewing its compliance with the state\u2019s Information Privacy Act.\nGuardian Australia understands Green has asked the council for more information on its data security but is yet to be convinced its collection of private conversations is lawful. But a spokeswoman for Queensland police told Guardian Australia there was no plan to investigate whether the scheme was also a breach of the Invasion of Privacy Act. Green, the Queensland Law Society and the Queensland Council for Civil Liberties have all raised concerns the scheme violates that act, which is administered by police. Bill Potts, a spokesman for the law society, said if court cases relied on recordings shown to be obtained illegally \u201cthen it\u2019s inadmissible and the much vaunted reason for doing it is nullified\u201d. The mayor of Ipswich, Paul Pisasale, rejected the audio surveillance scheme as \u201cpushing Big Brother too far\u201d. Pisasale said adding audio to CCTV did not \u201cadd to the value of a safe city\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why it would add value to a court case, and unfortunately it\u2019d be picking up everybody\u2019s voice, so it means that people couldn\u2019t have a normal conversation in a public place,\u201d Pisasale said. \u201cI can understand people feeling that it is an invasion of privacy. \u201cBugging places \u2013 that\u2019s what it is \u2013 in public spaces, you don\u2019t need it. It\u2019s a no-brainer.\u201d A spokeswoman for the Queensland police minister, Mark Ryan, said his office had been assured by police they could not investigate without a complaint from a member of the public. Potts, a prominent criminal lawyer, said that was not true. \u201cSeriously, police have a perfect right to investigate offences which they themselves see occurring \u2013 in murder there\u2019s no complaint,\u201d he said. \u201cThe council has announced they\u2019ve set up [this] system \u2026 the police are aware of that. Why will they do nothing? \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like Inspector Clouseau not seeing the end of his nose. It\u2019s there. It\u2019s sticking out in front of them. What more do they actually need?\u201d The Moreton Bay council, north of Brisbane, which plans to extend audio across its network of 874 cameras, may face pressure to abandon the scheme if the commissioner rules it unlawful. Green may also direct the council to stop recording audio by issuing a compliance notice. His findings, which he will report to the parliamentary committee on legal affairs and community safety, are likely to set a precedent for other councils considering the scheme. The police spokeswoman said officers in the Moreton Bay region had been consulted by the council on the audio recording scheme, but did not request it. A spokeswoman for the council said it was \u201csatisfied its use of the CCTV footage and audio is consistent with its obligations under the Information Privacy Act\u201d. But she refused to say what the source of its legal advice was, or whether it was also satisfied it complied with the Invasion of Privacy Act. \u201cCouncil will continue to work together with the office of the information commissioner to ensure its CCTV network operates in accordance with the act and protects personal information of the community,\u201d the spokeswoman said. Last week Green said the council\u2019s willingness to cooperate with his office on the issue was \u201ca positive step in the process\u201d. \u201cWhile I have concerns about the upgraded cameras\u2019 ability to record audio, it\u2019s vital to have all the facts before proceeding further,\u201d he said. Potts has repeatedly called on the attorney-general, Yvette D\u2019Ath, and Ryan to say whether they condoned the council\u2019s recordings of allegedly private conversations in public.\nA spokeswoman for D\u2019Ath said the Department of Justice and Attorney General \u201cwas not consulted on this matter\u201d but that it did not \u201cprovide legal advice\u201d. \u201cThe attorney general understands this matter is being examined by the office of the information commissioner, which is an independent statutory body,\u201d the spokeswoman said. Section 43 of the Invasion of Privacy Act states that a person, or an executive officer of a corporation, faces up to two years jail if found guilty of recording a private conversation to which they are not party. Exceptions include listening devices worn by police or commonwealth agents with warrants.\n",

Berlin-based artist and technologist Adam Harvey aims to overwhelm and confuse these systems by presenting them with thousands of false hits so they can\u2019t tell which faces are real. The Hyperface project involves printing patterns on to clothing or textiles, which then appear to have eyes, mouths and other features that a computer can interpret as a face. This is not the first time Harvey has tried to confuse facial recognition software. During a previous project, CV Dazzle, he attempted to create an aesthetic of makeup and hairstyling that would cause machines to be unable to detect a face.\nSpeaking at the Chaos Communications Congress hacking conference in Hamburg, Harvey said: \u201cAs I\u2019ve looked at in an earlier project, you can change the way you appear, but, in camouflage you can think of the figure and the ground relationship. There\u2019s also an opportunity to modify the \u2018ground\u2019, the things that appear next to you, around you, and that can also modify the computer vision confidence score.\u201d Harvey\u2019s Hyperface project aims to do just that, he says, \u201coverloading an algorithm with what it wants, oversaturating an area with faces to divert the gaze of the computer vision algorithm.\u201d The resultant patterns, which Harvey created in conjunction with international interaction studio Hyphen-Labs, can be worn or used to blanket an area. \u201cIt can be used to modify the environment around you, whether it\u2019s someone next to you, whether you\u2019re wearing it, maybe around your head or in a new way.\u201d\nExplaining his hopes for how technologies like his would affect the world, Harvey showed an image of a street scene from the 1910s, pointing out that every figure in it is wearing a hat. \u201cIn 100 years from now, we\u2019re going to have a similar transformation of fashion and the way that we appear. What will that look like? Hopefully it will look like something that appears to optimise our personal privacy.\u201d To emphasise the extent to which facial recognition technology changes expectations of privacy, Harvey collated 47 different data points commercial and academic researchers claim to be able to discover from a 100x100 pixel facial image \u2013 around 2.5% of the size of a typical Instagram photo. Those include traits such as \u201ccalm\u201d or \u201ckind\u201d, criminal tendencies like \u201cpaedophile\u201d or \u201cwhite collar offender\u201d, and simple demographics like \u201cage\u201d and \u201cgender\u201d. Research from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, for instance, claims to be able to predict criminality from lip curvature, eye inner corner distance and the so-called nose-mouth angle. \u201cA lot of other researchers are looking at how to take that very small data and turn it into insights that can be used for marketing,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cWhat all this reminds me of is Francis Galton and eugenics. The real criminal, in these cases, are people who are perpetrating this idea, not the people who are being looked at.\u201d Harvey and Hyphen-Labs plan to reveal details on the Hyperface project this month, as part of Hyphen-Labs\u2019 new work NeuroSpeculative AfroFeminism.\n",

Andrew Tyrie MP wrote to Ciaran Martin, head of the new cybersecurity centre of UK surveillance agency GCHQ, saying the lines of responsibility and accountability for reducing cyber-threats are opaque. Tyrie\u2019s letter to Martin, who is leading the Cheltenham-based National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), uses last month\u2019s incident at Tesco Bank to illustrate the vulnerabilities of the financial system. In November, the banking arm of supermarket chain Tesco admitted that \u00a32.5m had been stolen from 9,000 accounts in an incident which raised fresh concerns about the methods used by financial services firms to detect cyber-attacks. Two-thirds of all major UK companies \u2013 not just financial services firms \u2013 have reported security breaches in the last year. The Bank of England has also listed the threat of cyber-attacks as one of the major risks facing the financial services industry. In his letter Tyrie, a Conservative MP, outlines the responsibility for cyber-threats as being shared between the Bank\u2019s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), the Financial Conduct Authority and GCHQ. In turn, the regulatory arms are responsible to the Treasury, while GCHQ reports through the foreign secretary.\nIn light of this, Tyrie said: \u201cIt is for consideration whether a single point of responsibility for cyber risk in the financial services sector, with full ownership of \u2013 and accountability for \u2013 financial cyber-threats is now required. It may be necessary to create a line of accountability to the Treasury for financial cybercrime.\u201d Tyrie also asks Martin for clarity on the objectives of NCSC, which was set up two months ago to take charge of the UK\u2019s defences against cyber-offences. \u201cLegacy systems, human error and deliberate attack have resulted in unacceptable interruptions to vital banking services and weakened the public\u2019s confidence in the banking system as a whole. The recent attack on Tesco Bank is only the latest example of criminals exploiting vulnerabilities in the banking industry\u2019s IT systems,\u201d said Tyrie. A spokesman for the NCSC said: \u201cWe have received this letter and there will be a government response in the New Year.\u201d\nThe parliamentary committee has been asking questions about the need for a clearer command structure to tackle cyber-attacks during its evidence sessions. Last week, Sam Woods, the Bank\u2019s deputy governor who runs PRA, was asked his views on the need for a single point of contact. Woods replied it was important to know which body was in charge of each incident rather than have the same point of contact. \u201cIt is essential that the intelligence community gives the regulators the technical and practical support they need to do their job. This means making sure that financial cybercrime has a high priority, and is not subordinate to other work,\u201d said Tyrie. \u201cCertainly, as millions of customers are exposed to the risks of cybercrime, a higher level of scrutiny and accountability for existing arrangements is needed,\u201d he added.\n",

For anybody with an interest in protecting democracy, privacy, freedom of expression, a free press and the safety and cybersecurity of everybody in the UK, Wednesday\u2019s EU court of justice judgment is cause for celebration. In a landmark ruling \u2013 its first major post-referendum judgment involving the UK \u2013 the court ruled that our government is breaking the law by collecting all our internet and phone call records, then opening them up freely to hundreds of organisations and agencies. This was a challenge brought by Labour deputy leader Tom Watson (and initially Brexit minister David Davis), and represented by Liberty, to the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act (Dripa) \u2013 a temporary \u201cemergency\u201d law covering state surveillance, rushed on to the statute books in a matter of days in 2014.\nIt makes communications companies store records of all our emails, texts, phone calls and internet correspondence. This treasure trove of private information can then be accessed by a huge number of organisations and government agencies \u2013 from police forces to HMRC \u2013 and of course by hostile powers and terrorist hackers too. If police wanted to root through your bedroom drawers, you\u2019d expect them to have a warrant and a bloody good reason. But if they want to dip into this deeply sensitive personal data, they have a year\u2019s supply of information sat waiting and can grant themselves permission. No need for sign-off from a judge. No need to suspect someone of a crime. We argued that this breached British people\u2019s rights \u2013 and on Wednesday the judges agreed. They said this national data hoard lets the state draw \u201cvery precise conclusions\u201d about people\u2019s private lives \u2013 including \u201ceveryday habits, permanent or temporary places of residence, daily or other movements, the activities carried out, the social relationships of those persons and the social environments frequented by them [\u2026] information that is no less sensitive, having regard to the right to privacy, than the actual content of communications\u201d. The judges also said it\u2019s not right to gather data on innocent people \u2013 that instead it must only be harvested where there is suspicion of serious crime. And they said if someone is spied on, they have a right to know about it afterwards so that they can challenge it if it was wrong, and so we all know the true scale of the state\u2019s surveillance regime. These are simple, vital safeguards to introduce fairness, accountability and transparency into an otherwise shady world. Dripa expires on 31 December. So why does any of this matter? Because a new law \u2013 the Investigatory Powers Act \u2013 has been passed to replace it. Think of it as the Death Star of surveillance laws \u2013 huge, impenetrable, and capable of doing massive damage. It replicates all the same powers found unlawful yesterday \u2013 but it goes much further. It forces service providers to generate and store records of all our internet histories. Every site we visit, every app we open, every piece of software we download. What do your internet searches give away, when you think about it, that might be dangerous in the wrong person\u2019s hands? Your religion? Sexual interests? Health concerns? Political views? As with Dripa, this can then be accessed by hundreds of public bodies \u2013 everyone from the Department for Work and Pensions to the Gambling Commission. No need for a judge to authorise access. No need for suspicion of crime. After yesterday\u2019s ruling, the unlawfulness of these new powers is beyond question too. They\u2019re also a major threat to our cybersecurity. These records are stored in vast databases which \u2013 at a time when companies and governments are under increasingly debilitating attacks from hackers \u2013 create goldmines for criminals and foreign spies. And it\u2019s set to cost an estimated \u00a3170m.\nBut there\u2019s more. Under the Investigatory Powers Act, the state has the ability to indiscriminately hack phones and computers, intercept our communications and build and acquire huge databases containing sensitive information on millions of people \u2013 which could include everything from your Oyster card logs to Facebook back-ups. The government has announced it will try to fight the EU court\u2019s ruling. Instead of wasting public money battling unwinnable cases, we urge it to swallow its pride, shoulder the responsibility of being democratic leaders and amend the act to create a targeted surveillance system \u2013 not one that sweeps up everyone\u2019s private lives and swamps our spies with too much data. The British state has used fear, spin and the guise of counter-terrorism to sneak through totalitarian-style surveillance laws. But our message to the government is clear: the jig is up. Since the Investigatory Powers Act passed, more than 200,000 people have signed a petition calling for its repeal \u2013 and if the government doesn\u2019t act, Liberty will see them in court. There\u2019s reason to hope in 2017. This is a big victory, and it will be the first of many. And we all know what happened to the Death Star in the end.\n",

Whether you pay with a smartphone (that tracks you whenever it is operating), or with a proposed swipecard (that would track you whenever you use it), it does you wrong by tracking your movements. You can fill your car with gasoline anonymously, paying cash; electric cars should offer the same.\nThe Nissan Leaf violates privacy in another way: it contains a cellphone data modem that transmits when the car runs. Aside from the data it may send (without asking your permission), merely informing the telephone network where you are violates your privacy. My friend who bought a Nissan Leaf disconnected the modem so his car would not track him. The proposed London \u201ctube for cars\u201d raises a similar issue: if it requires users to identify themselves, it will be an injustice. Due to various digital technologies, we now face far more surveillance than the inhabitants of the former Soviet Union.

The home secretary, Amber Rudd, hailed the Investigatory Powers Act 2016 as \u201cworld-leading legislation\u201d that provided \u201cunprecedented transparency and substantial privacy protection\u201d. But privacy campaigners claimed that it would provide an international standard to authoritarian regimes around the world to justify their own intrusive surveillance powers. The new surveillance law requires web and phone companies to store everyone\u2019s web browsing histories for 12 months and give the police, security services and official agencies unprecedented access to the data. It also provides the security services and police with new powers to hack into computers and phones and to collect communications data in bulk. The law requires judges to sign off police requests to view journalists\u2019 call and web records, but the measure has been described as \u201ca death sentence for investigative journalism\u201d in the UK.\nThe Home Office says some of the provisions in the act will require extensive testing and will not be in place for some time. However, powers to require web and phone companies to collect customers\u2019 communications data will be in force before 31 December, the date when the current Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014 expires. The home secretary said: \u201cThe Investigatory Powers Act is world-leading legislation, that provides unprecedented transparency and substantial privacy protection. \u201cThe government is clear that, at a time of heightened security threat, it is essential our law enforcement and security and intelligence services have the power they need to keep people safe. The internet presents new opportunities for terrorists and we must ensure we have the capabilities to confront this challenge. But it is also right that these powers are subject to strict safeguards and rigorous oversight.\u201d Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group, responded to the home secretary\u2019s \u201cworld-leading\u201d claim, saying: \u201cShe is right, it is one of the most extreme surveillance laws ever passed in a democracy. The IP Act will have an impact that goes beyond the UK\u2019s shores. It is likely that other countries, including authoritarian regimes with poor human rights records, will use this law to justify their own intrusive surveillance powers.\u201d He said the legislation was debated and passed while the public, media and politicians were preoccupied with Brexit: \u201cNow that the bill has passed, there is renewed concern about the extent of the powers that will be given to the police and security agencies. \u201cIn particular, people appear to be worried about new powers that mean our web browsing activity can be collected by internet service providers and viewed by the police and a whole range of government departments. Parliament may choose to ignore calls for a debate but this could undermine public confidence in these intrusive powers.\u201d The European court of justice is due to clarify its rulings on state surveillance shortly, in a case brought by the deputy leader of the Labour party, Tom Watson. The court\u2019s ruling could lead to parts of the new legislation being declared unlawful and in need of amendment, including restrictions on how the personal confidential data involved can be used and accessed.\n",

        "body": "A behavioural surveillance scheme being trialled by a Queensland council in an attempt to anticipate antisocial and illegal acts has prompted concern, with civil liberties advocates saying the technology is \u201cstraight out of 1984\u201d and has been linked to racial profiling. The Queensland privacy commissioner, Philip Green, confirmed he had not been consulted by Toowoomba regional council over its trial of \u201cprivacy-invasive\u201d behavioural recognition software with CCTV cameras, which has been linked to racial profiling in the United States. Toowoomba\u2019s foray into behavioural surveillance technology was also criticised by civil libertarians who warned that people deemed \u201cabnormal\u201d by an algorithm faced being harassed by authorities.\nOn Monday the council rolled out a month-long trial of \u201ccamera analytics software\u201d, which purportedly links with CCTV networks to identify safety risks posed by members of the public. The technology, sold by a company called iOmniscient, includes facial and number-plate recognition technology and touts an ability to anticipate antisocial behaviour in crowds, such as vandalism and other crimes. Green said the council had not consulted his office about the rollout of technology despite it raising serious privacy concerns \u2013 the second time in a month a Queensland council has done so. \u201cFrankly I don\u2019t know what [the scheme] is, I have no visibility on it, they haven\u2019t consulted with us to my knowledge and I\u2019d like to look at it,\u201d Green told Guardian Australia. He said \u201cwell-intended\u201d councils were \u201ctrying to explore new technology\u201d but in this case the move provoked \u201csome serious debates about profiling people\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s where I think it can get scary because facial recognition\u2019s not that accurate, mood recognition as Facebook\u2019s trying to run out or whatever Toowoomba is trying to do with behavioural pattern recognition \u2013 all those algorithms have failures,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a wider debate that\u2019s beyond privacy, around the adequacy of the decision-making process based on it and that\u2019s a wider thing for artificial intelligence generally. \u201cIf they\u2019re using a privacy-invasive technology in the first place to base their algorithms on, there\u2019s a few concerns across the board.\u201d Michael Cope, the president of the Queensland Council for Civil Liberties, said the technology was \u201cstraight out of 1984\u201d and had been linked in the US with a tendency to over-select racial minorities. \u201cThe algorithms which underlie this technology have at their heart arbitrary concepts of what is normal,\u201d Cope said. \u201cPeople are selected for attention by authorities on the basis of their supposedly abnormal behaviour or appearance.\n\u201cHow would you feel if you are innocently minding your own business in the mall and you are approached by the police in front of everyone because a machine thinks you look odd?\u201d iOmniscient\u2019s Sydney office could not be reached for comment. But the company website details a product called IQ-120 which \u201chas the ability to detect behaviour deemed suspicious such as loitering or running, based on the speed and pattern of their movement\u201d. Staff in CCTV monitoring rooms can \u201cmore closely monitor people whose behaviour seems suspicious, potentially averting crises before they happen\u201d, it says. The software can be customised to identify behaviour a client deems \u201csuspicious for their situation\u201d, it says. It gives the example of tracking potential thieves in car parks by configuring software to \u201crecognise that a normal person would walk directly to their car while generating an alarm for any person that is seen to walk form car to car as they decide which one to steal\u201d. It could also detect \u201caberrant behaviour\u201d such as when \u201ca suicidal person may loiter in one place as they build up courage to blow themselves up, or before they jump off a train platform\u201d. Cope called on Toowoomba council to reveal what data from its records was being \u201cfed in to this software and what data is being fed back into the databases\u201d, adding: \u201cWe object to the creation of vast databases.\u201d The use of behavioural recognition in US airports had resulted in \u201cmany innocent people being harassed by security staff\u201d, he said. \u201cThe problem is that when a machine makes the assessment, the pressure is on for the operator to take action lest they be accused of negligence,\u201d he said. \u201cThe result is that the number of innocent people being accosted by the authorities will go up.\u201d Green said it was preferable if councils \u201ccould talk to us about it before they roll out\u201d technology that clearly infringed on people\u2019s privacy. This would allow a \u201cprivacy-impact analysis [because] that\u2019s going to be the standard internationally\u201d and an assessment of whether it was \u201cin proportion\u201d with its purpose. It was important that the public was involved in a debate about the \u201cproportionality\u201d of such schemes, he said. The Gold Coast city council has consulted Green\u2019s office on a trial of facial recognition surveillance in the lead-up to the 2018 Commonwealth Games. Green said even with the security risks around such an event, given the high-level presence of law enforcement, he personally wondered \u201cwhether councils should be getting into that sort of thing\u201d.\nThe commissioner is awaiting a detailed response from Moreton Bay regional council to his queries about its rollout of audio recordings with its CCTV camera network last month. He previously said he was concerned the scheme might breach the state\u2019s Information Privacy Act, as well as criminal law in the Invasion of Privacy Act. Cope said Queensland councils with camera surveillance had \u201cconsistently behaved as if the Information Privacy Act does not apply to them\u201d. On Tuesday a Toowoomba councillor, Geoff McDonald, said the trial would give other councils a chance to see potential benefits for crowd management, locating missing objects and helping to find missing people. He said there were \u201cpotential community safety benefits through automatic or early identification of antisocial behaviour and potential safety risks\u201d, according to the Sunshine Coast Daily. McDonald was contacted for further comment.\n",

        "body": "The privacy of the public is at risk of being invaded on a mass scale without its consent as the collection of big data meshes with proliferation of video surveillance, the government\u2019s CCTV watchdog has warned. Launching a new three-year strategy, the surveillance camera commissioner, Tony Porter, admitted that regulators and the government were struggling to keep up with the pace of technological change. He said he was alarmed by the way overt surveillance from CCTV, body cameras and drones could become even more invasive than intended as captured images of people are brought together with advances in facial recognition and then compared against other monitored data about individuals and their movements. \u201cWhat most worries me is the impact of big data and integration of video surveillance,\u201d said Porter, a former senior counter-terrorism officer who has just been reappointed for a second three-year term as surveillance camera commissioner. As an example, he warned that the Metropolitan police was playing \u201cfast and loose\u201d with citizens\u2019 data by its failure to delete number-plate records beyond a two-year limit. The database of millions of vehicle number plate records has been retained since the London Olympics in 2012. Porter told the Guardian: \u201cThe problem with the Olympic feed is that it has continued in perpetuity. It moved from being a pilot in the Olympic Games to a position that is now untenable. The police need to review why they are retaining that data and get rid of it.\u201d He pointed out that police have the power to retain number-plate records for two years, but said it was open to legal challenge by retaining data beyond this limit. \u201cTo retain into 2017 without giving evidence and grounds is questionable. There needs to be a very close look at that. And my understanding is that the police are doing that. The danger of delay is that you have a state body that is prepared to play fast and loose with the retention of citizens\u2019 data when there is no requirement.\u201d Porter\u2019s new strategy, published on Tuesday, points out that an overwhelming majority of people currently support the use of CCTV in public places. But he questions whether this support can continue because of the way surveillance is changing. \u201cI\u2019m worried about overt surveillance becoming much more invasive because it is linked to everything else,\u201d Porter said. \u201cYou might have a video photograph of somebody shopping in Tesco. Now it is possible to link that person to their pre-movements, their mobile phone records, any sensor detectors within their house or locality. As smart cities move forward, these are challenges are so much greater for people like myself. And members of the public need to decide whether they are still happy with this.\u201d He added: \u201cThe nightmare scenario is that there is a lack of understanding about how big and effective this can be. This technology is there to protect us, but there needs to be informed consent about what it is capable of doing. Body-worn video, for example, or facial recognition \u2013 that can identify people on databases who didn\u2019t know they were on databases.\u201d Porter conceded that advances in technology such as drones have helped police solve crimes and hunt for missing people. But he added: \u201cSurveillance cameras are becoming much more integrated into the internet \u2026 The problem is when new and advancing technology is brought together by well-meaning people that actually invades people\u2019s privacy, or worse, leaves privacy at risk of theft or uploading on YouTube.\u201d Porter said part of his new strategy would set a \u201ctripwire\u201d to warn authorities about the privacy impact of new technology. In recent weeks Porter has expressed alarm about the proliferation of body-worn video, notably in hospitals, and by the way the security contractor G4S was using it in the homes of asylum seekers without their consent. Porter said there was mounting evidence that body-worn video was being used without sufficient regard to privacy. He gave the example of an unnamed local authority which pointed a CCTV camera on to a resident\u2019s front door, then compounded the error by dispatching a council officer equipped with a body-worn video to apologise for the misplaced camera. Porter urged authorities to follow his code of practice, which insists that surveillance cameras should only be used if there is pressing public need.\n",

        "body": "Rights campaigners are among those sounding the alarm over the erosion of press freedom in Canada after it emerged that police in Montreal had spent several months monitoring the phone of a journalist in order to identify his sources. La Presse, one of Canada\u2019s oldest and largest newspapers, said on Monday that at least 24 surveillance warrants were obtained by Montreal police to track the phone of columnist Patrick Lagac\u00e9. The warrants enabled the force\u2019s special investigation unit to track Lagac\u00e9\u2019s whereabouts using the GPS in his phone, as well as monitor incoming and outgoing text messages and calls. The revelations left Lagac\u00e9 shaken. \u201cI was appalled,\u201d he said. \u201cI was living in the fiction that police officers wouldn\u2019t dare do that, and in the fiction that judges were protecting journalists \u2013 and hence the public \u2013 against this type of police intrusion.\u201d Montreal police defended their actions, pointing to what they called an exceptional situation. The surveillance was part of an investigation into allegations that police officers in the drugs and street gangs unit had fabricated evidence and which saw five officers arrested this summer. Lagac\u00e9 became intertwined in the investigation after police detected contact between him and one of the officers under investigation. Police actions were aimed at investigating police officers, not Lagac\u00e9, police chief Philippe Pichet said on Monday. \u201cWe are very aware of the importance of freedom of the press,\u201d said Pichet. \u201cBut on the other hand, there were criminal allegations against a police officer \u2026 and we have a job to do.\u201d The force did not break any laws in pursuing the warrants, he noted. \u201cWe respected every law to obtain the warrant we got. We followed the rules, and the judge authorised the warrant.\u201d To his knowledge, no other journalists had been placed under surveillance but he said he could not guarantee that. Lagac\u00e9 dismissed the police chief\u2019s explanation. \u201cThe funny fact is that their suspicions involved stories I did not work on,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a real witch-hunt going on at the Montreal police department. It has been going on for years, they have been trying to find out who dare speaks to reporters.\u201d Denis Coderre, the mayor of Montreal, called the matter \u201ctroubling\u201d but refused calls by the opposition to force the police chief to step aside. The province\u2019s public security minister, Martin Coiteux, also weighed in, telling reporters that he found the news \u201cvery worrisome\u201d and said his department was examining whether police followed the proper procedures. Little more could be done, he said, warning it was not the place of government to interfere with a police investigation or judicial decisions. The revelations sparked condemnation from groups across the country. Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s major media organisations conveyed their \u201cindignation and concern\u201d in an open letter on Monday. \u201cThe head of the Montreal police department, Philippe Pichet, must answer the following question, fresh in the minds of all journalists: Who has been spied on? And who is still being spied on by the police?,\u201d they wrote. Amid fresh claims on Tuesday that Montreal police had been combing through their employees\u2019 phone records to track contact with three other journalists, a dozen legal experts called on the Qu\u00e9bec government to launch a public inquiry. \u201cThere\u2019s no point in throwing stones at judge who act independently, but we can and should review the system to ensure that fundamental rights are protected,\u201d they said in a statement. The Canadian Journalists for Free Expression said it had sent a letter to the mayor of Montreal and the city\u2019s police force demanding that the practice of spying on journalists be condemned. \u201cIt really fits an extremely troubling pattern around policing and security agencies in Canada,\u201d said Tom Henheffer of the organisation.\nRecently Qu\u00e9bec police seized the computer of a reporter from the Journal de Montr\u00e9al over concerns that he had illegally obtained information for a story. Their actions followed revelations that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police had followed two journalists for nine days without any kind of authorisation and came as the RCMP is engaged in legal action aimed at forcing Vice Media to hand over background materials relating to a series of stories on a suspected terrorist. The extent of the issue was highlighted by the fact that police said their surveillance of Lagac\u00e9 was completely legal, said Henheffer. \u201cYou can\u2019t even make the argument that this is just a few bad apples because it was authorised by a justice of the peace. This is the system as it\u2019s supposed to work. Which just goes to show that the whole system is broken.\u201d These are the kinds of issues more often associated with countries such as Egypt or Turkey, he asserted. \u201cCanadians love to trick themselves into this illusion that we\u2019re a happy, friendly country with strong democratic institutions and the fact is, that\u2019s just not true anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have let our rights erode horrifically in this country.\u201d\n",

The official public response from the government didn\u2019t touch on the 17 years of unlawful practice, but merely declared it was \u201cpleased the tribunal has confirmed the current lawfulness of the existing bulk communications data and bulk personal dataset regimes\u201d. While underplaying the significance of this ruling, the government is ebullient about how Theresa May\u2019s investigatory powers bill \u2013 more commonly known as the snooper\u2019s charter \u2013 will usher in a new era of transparency, honesty and rigorous oversight. So if you are one the many people concerned about following the rules and how the public\u2019s personal data is being protected, what is the government doing to reassure you? Very little.\nInstead, the unwillingness to confront the government\u2019s past mistakes reinforces the dangers inherent when parliament is asked to grapple with legislation such as the investigatory powers bill that would enshrine far-reaching, highly advanced and deeply intrusive surveillance powers. Rather than drawing a line under bad practice and forging a new era of transparent, clearly avowed and properly authorised and regulated surveillance, the bill is so byzantine and complex that it could lead to another 17 years of creative interpretation of the rules. This ruling should be a warning to all of us that when we give the government an inch, it will take a mile. Let us be clear about what it has done when it says it has been collecting \u201cbulk communications data\u201d. Rather than seek the creation of transparent and democratically approved laws, it instead spent 17 years using an archaic, obscure, vague clause from a pre-internet piece of legislation \u2013 section 94 of the Telecommunications Act 1984 \u2013 to obtain regular feeds of bulk communications data from telecommunications companies. In short, the government has been collecting your personal data from your phone and email provider \u2013 who you\u2019ve been communicating with, when you communicated with them, where you were at the time. This data provides a detailed picture of who you are, your friendships and family relationships, your interests and movements, including your political views, your sexuality and who knows what else. And the government has been taking it all in for over a decade. Without you knowing about it. Without even parliament knowing about it. The first official, independent review of these section 94 directions came out only in July this year. Sir Stanley Burnton, the interception of communications commissioner, who conducted the review, commented somewhat understatedly that there were \u201cdifficulties when statutes are operated in secret and where there is a lack of statutory codified procedures\u201d. \u201cDifficulties\u201d is one way to put it. The potential for abuse, misuse and skirting the rule of law is another. What we have seen emerge from disclosed documents is that the cloak of secrecy resulted in massive troves of our personal data becoming a kind of Facebook for spies. Staff had to be repeatedly warned not to search for or access information about other members of staff, neighbours, friends, acquaintances, family members and public figures. Other independent experts have revealed further abuses. David Anderson QC, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, noted at para 5.42 of his review of bulk powers that a \u201cvery serious incident\u201d took place in 2014. Burnton noted \u201c230 errors\u201d by the security service between January 2015 and July 2016.\nMissing from the narrative is what happened to the victims. With no provisions for notification, we will never know if our data was misused, however egregious the incident. The investigatory powers bill takes a tiny step in the right direction by allowing for error reporting in limited, discretionary circumstances. But that is not nearly enough. Error reporting should be mandatory to give us effective rights to seek redress. Of even greater concern than abuse, however, is the threat to a democratic society created when we normalise that idea of putting us all under surveillance. But neither the government nor parliament has fully confronted the main consequence of the bill, which enshrines in law the powers of bulk surveillance that led to the collection of all our data. Parliament has been hobbled by the many layers of this enormous, complex mostly unfathomable piece of legislation, accompanied by hundreds of pages of equally opaque codes of practice. It is true that we have moved on from an era of a vacuum in law. But what we have got instead is a new era of legal labyrinthian complexity. So, with the investigatory powers bill just weeks from becoming law, we find ourselves at the precipice of the post-Snowden surveillance settlement. Rather than rolling back the mass surveillance practices that have been exposed in the aftermath of Edward Snowden blowing the whistle, some of which Monday\u2019s judgment finally found to be unlawful, May\u2019s bill is hurtling forward like a freight train. If it fails to change course, we may again find ourselves in court challenging the state\u2019s mass surveillance practices. While it is the 11th hour, it is not too late for parliament to stop this vicious cycle of unlawfulness that thrives on rules that no one understands.\n",

        "body": "Privacy campaigners have expressed anger over a vote by 64 Labour peers to back an expansion of state surveillance powers, within hours of a ruling by top judges that the spying agencies unlawfully scooped up personal confidential information on a massive scale for more than a decade. The Labour peers voted with the government to ensure that major new powers are handed to the security services to get access to records tracking every citizen\u2019s web use for the past 12 months.\nThe Liberal Democrat attempt to delete the powers to order the collection and storage of the new internet connection records from the investigatory powers bill in the House of Lords was voted down by 75 to 292. It was notable that neither the former Labour home secretary Lord Blunkett nor the new shadow attorney general, and former Liberty director, Lady Chakrabarti, took part in the vote. The 64 Labour peers who voted with the government included frontbench spokespersons, Lady Hayter and Lord Rosser and the party\u2019s chief whip, Lord Bassam. The vote came just hours after the ruling by the investigatory powers tribunal, the only court to hear complaints against MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, that the security services had until 2015 secretly and illegally collected huge volumes of confidential data of millions of British citizens without adequate or safeguards. The Labour peers\u2019 vote also contrasted with a sharp attack on the investigatory powers bill by the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, who described it as \u201cdraconian\u201d and said the ruling demonstrated why it needed amending. \u201cThe latest ruling from the investigatory powers tribunal should be a sharp reminder that we should not lightly hand over powers to the security services and police and that greater accountability is needed. The government\u2019s bill needs amending in all these areas,\u201d said Abbott, who has sharpened Labour\u2019s approach to the bill since the party abstained on its Commons second reading. The Lib Dem Lord Paddick said: \u201cLabour\u2019s decision not to back us in opposing this huge intrusion into our privacy shows once and for all that they cannot claim to be the party of civil liberties, regardless of who sits on their benches. \u201cInternet connection records are ill-conceived and disproportionate and no doubt this fight will continue in the courts.\u201d Jim Killock, the Director of the Open Rights Group also strongly criticised the Labour peers. He said: \u201cLabour did not table any serious amendments to this draconian legislation in the House of Lords. Labour is simply failing to hold the government to account. \u201cThe Labour Lords had an opportunity to improve the IP bill and make it closer to becoming a surveillance law fit for a democracy not a dictatorship. They could have called for proposals to record UK citizens\u2019 web browsing history to be scrapped or demanded that the police need independent authorisation to access our data.\u201d But Labour\u2019s leader in the Lords, Angela Smith told the Guardian: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty rich for the Lib Dems to question our peers over this, when a number of their own side also voted against the amendment. It\u2019s also the case that we were voting to protect a concession achieved earlier in the day \u2013 and which follows our general strategy towards the bill, to try and improve it wherever necessary. \u201cThe impressive work of Labour colleagues in the Commons during the report stage there and our own shadow home affairs team in the Lords has contributed significantly to the government\u2019s tabling of over 300 amendments to its own bill \u2013 including on greater safeguards against abuse,\u201d Lady Smith said. \u201cAppalling as the tribunal ruling is, it is historic and the regimes used to hold and collect data since 2015 have been legal and appropriate. This bill updates and improves the framework used by agencies and the way existing investigatory powers are authorised. It also enables, for the first time, judicial commissioners to veto warrant approvals made by the home secretary.\u201d The peers secured a concession that access to web browsing histories should not be given to the police involved in investigations into offences that carried a prison sentence of less than 12 months. The government had proposed the threshold should be six months.\n",

Don\u2019t be too disappointed if they\u2019re not following you back, because they\u2019re probably still reading your tweets. Twitter isn\u2019t exactly the first port of call for shy and retiring types, particularly if you use it under your own name, so how do you approach social media if you\u2019re a super-secret spy agency? Use it as an excuse to improve your personal brand We know GCHQ is full of boffins all working to hack our iPhones, listen to conversations with lasers pointed at windows, and generally undertake nefarious spycraft. This is creepy and unusual, but the Twitter account is a chance to distract us with hilarious content.\nJust like Julian Assange\u2019s pet cat\u2019s account, you can use Twitter to show us the softer, cuddlier side of the organisation. What are the amusing messages you guys leave on the communal fridges? What\u2019s the funniest sext you\u2019ve intercepted from a member of Plaid Cymru? Why not jump into the saved drafts of Britain\u2019s finest comedians and pinch some material before they\u2019ve tweeted it \u2013 it isn\u2019t tweet theft if it\u2019s still a draft. You could get a few retweets by leaking the end of the next two Star Wars films, or showing us Donald Trump\u2019s tax receipts, and maybe we\u2019d overlook the vast technological power at your disposal to track our lives if you did. It\u2019s worth a try. Don\u2019t tweet stuff out of context Beware the capacity for people on Twitter to read what you say completely out of context and in bad faith. It is not a medium for nuance, subtlety, irony or sarcasm. You should probably hand your account to one of your hypernerds, so that he or she can tweet stuff that is incapable of being misunderstood.\nResist the urge to be too nerdy though \u2013 nobody wants to read tweets in binary. Don\u2019t use it to arrange your social life First there is nothing more cringe-inducing and gauche than using public tweets to arrange to meet up with people in the real world. If you genuinely do have an interesting social life, you don\u2019t need to tweet about it. Second, it\u2019s probably best for spies to avoid advertising their weekend plans \u2013 you\u2019re not the only security agency monitoring Twitter. DON\u2019T USE ALL CAPS Don\u2019t use crazy shouty caps unless it\u2019s an emergency. They\u2019re deeply uncool, and will probably also make people fear for the future of the country. If there\u2019s some sort of imminent cybersecurity threat, then hit caps lock, but if you just have an extreme reaction to a piece of celebrity gossip, hold off. Hilarious animated gifs won\u2019t make us feel better about mass surveillance Don\u2019t try to turn the ceaseless monitoring of the population with your giant supercomputers into some kind of meme. Distract us from your purpose, don\u2019t remind us what you\u2019re actually doing. Nobody wants to recall that you guys have the gizmos to read old Snapchats or dig up our AOL messages from when we were teenagers, because that sort of embarrassment would genuinely kill us. Be careful not to tweet from the wrong account or DM fail\nGCHQ doesn\u2019t need to start criticising members of the intelligence and security committee as \u201cboring snoring\u201d or accidently upload pictures of someone\u2019s breakfast. If you guys can\u2019t keep up your Twitter security, what possible hope is there for the rest of the realm? DM fails from the communications branch of our intelligence service would be equal parts amusing and terrifying. Don\u2019t let the trolls get you down You\u2019re going to receive some hostility, whatever you say and do, because that\u2019s what Twitter is about. Don\u2019t start using your powers to exact revenge, however tempting that might be. Just ignore them. I appreciate that for professional reasons you probably don\u2019t want to start muting people, but you can make the most of your verified status (congrats on that) by only looking at your mentions from other verified people. Don\u2019t use a bot Resist the urge to code some bot to tweet on your behalf. Microsoft tried that one and it became a Holocaust-denier. Stay human. Don\u2019t let it distract you too much from the day job\nThe worst thing about Twitter is probably the disgusting amount of time you\u2019ll find you spend on it. Please don\u2019t drop the ball while you\u2019re arguing the merits of Brexit or reading lengthy debates about intersectionality. Try to stick to the day job. The people you follow suggest you\u2019re going to focus on security (except for Katherine Jenkins, that\u2019s an interesting choice?) so hopefully this is all just a big PR exercise, and not the beginning of an awful, time-eating addiction from which there is no escape.\n",

        "body": "Flicking through photocopied pages, and pausing, and then taking a deep breath. And then again, turning over to a new page allowing yourself time to absorb the sentiments, before carefully moving on, slowing down time around you to let the new ideas settle. These are the initial movements, the capsules of realisation, for a rookie zine reader. At once so ordinary and yet so overwhelmingly liberating, the transition to this from being a passive news reader via social media can leave you feeling giddy. For me, this is because the power of a zine is the inextricable, life-affirming granting of permission to speak.\nThere\u2019s a liberty to creating, or witnessing subversive material knowing that it won\u2019t be monitored, that the information is contained only within the pages of the zine. The trustworthiness of a physical object in our current age is strangely compelling. Links shared via Facebook or messenger apps can be intercepted, logged, or dispersed otherwise into the ether. Especially for teenagers, zines counter the anxiety and subsequent frantic deletion of browser history so that your family can\u2019t see it. Hide it under your bed instead, or in a zipped inner sanctum within your school bag. I must have first picked up a zine at a punk show, or maybe it was a hole in the wall pop-up store. I started reading lighter zines with a confessional or humorously therapeutic spin, before moving on to zines with an interest in queer life and resistance. Now, my fascination is on an emerging strain of self-publishing, one that specifically acts as a way of navigating (and circumventing) online surveillance. Just months ago I put out a zine focused on \u201ccyborgs\u201d: a loose metaphor for the way we have become socially and physically inseparable from technology, and the implications that has. Zines have long been used as a method of political organising in activist cultures and sub-cultures, so this is not exactly new \u2013 it\u2019s more a continuation of a tactic that in recent years has become important once again. The popular television show Mr Robot and its success in pop culture, as well as media spotlighting on whistleblowers Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning signals a shift in consciousness. These events have spurred people to assess their own moral standpoint in regards to institutional transparency. In addition, widespread disillusionment with online surveillance, and the commodification of our social media usage, has pushed people to seek alternatives to online communities. You can find zines catering to all kinds of interests via online anarchist libraries, which are easily accessible. Such websites encourage the distribution of hand-printed resources. Mia Van Den Bos is a researcher and curator of Sister Gallery in Adelaide, a space for new technologies and communication within art. She says that part of the appeal of zines is that \u201cprinted zines aren\u2019t networked, so there\u2019s no logging on IP addresses and the ability to track where information has come from and who has accessed it.\u201d Zines are accessible, often friendly to the reader and easy and cheap to make. If you have a printer and a spare few hours and some ideas, you can become a zine publisher just like anyone else. The process of zine-making becomes meaningful when you realise how differently people engage with them \u2013 readers become more connected to the tactile experience of a booklet, often making for more mindful and considered consumption.\nZines don\u2019t necessarily exist to peddle consumer agendas. Sponsored and targeted content have been growing in popularity online, and while that may be necessary for the survival of journalism, the pursuit of clicks sometimes becomes a conflict with the expression of integrity, or even merely thoughtfulness. These products of teen rebellion stand in direct opposition to what older generations assume about millennials. Just years ago, people were saying that print was dead \u2013 that as a medium it would not be able to find a foothold within a digital landscape. But instead, it\u2019s actually just evolved, adapting to the needs and wants of the people who access it. New print formats have appeared, it seems, out of necessity, and not just for aesthetic value. The main, streamlined forms of online news and communication that young people have taken for granted have not existed forever. As citizens, as responsible humans who feel a need for justice and transparency from the media and from corporate monoliths, we shouldn\u2019t hesitate to look towards old media as a way to alleviate our anxieties about online communication.\n",

Enforcement body TV Licensing said it expected the vast majority of people to \u201cobey the rules\u201d which extend the requirement for a licence beyond live viewing. Reports had suggested that the BBC would use a new \u201cfleet\u201d of detector vans to monitor Wi-Fi connections for people using iPlayer. However, a spokesman for TV Licensing told Press Association it did not plan to carry out any form of mass surveillance.\n\u201cWe expect most people will simply obey the law,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not going to use mass surveillance techniques, we are not going to ask internet providers for IP addresses, and in fact we will simply use existing enforcement processes and techniques which we believe to be adequate and appropriate.\u201d Neither the BBC nor TV Licensing are prepared to discuss the techniques they use to identify people who do not have not paid the \u00a3145.50 a year fee but still watch BBC content. However, they are authorised to use various forms of more targeted surveillance under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act. In July the government introduced legislation to close the loophole, which the BBC claims is costing it as much as \u00a3150m a year. The move was agreed as part of negotiations over the future shape and funding of the corporation which is having to make major cuts after being told to cover the more than \u00a3700m cost of providing free licences to the over-75s.\nThough people watching catch-up BBC content online will now be asked to confirm that they have a licence, there are doubts about how to enforce the rules at scale. The BBC has said it does not have plans to introduce a sign-in linked to licences. A BBC Source told the Guardian on Wednesday: \u201cThere are no plans for people to enter their licence details into BBC iPlayer at present because TV Licensing has a range of enforcement techniques they\u2019ll continue to use. We\u2019ll look at how effective these are before considering whether an extra verification system is required.\n",

        "body": "The Crimean peninsula, annexed by Russia in 2014, has swiftly degenerated into the scene of the greatest repression being conducted anywhere in the entire country. The targets of the Kremlin\u2019s crackdown are the Crimean Tatars, the ethnic group that originally formed the Crimean nation on the Black Sea peninsula. Between the 13th and 18th centuries the Tatars enjoyed their own state, and since 2014 they have been campaigning to return their homeland to Ukrainian rule. For this they have become the collective enemy of Russia. They are now victims of hate and persecution, and not for the first time in their tragic history. In May 1944, Joseph Stalin ordered the mass resettlement of Tatars, after accusing them of collaborating with the Nazis. At the time they made up about a fifth of the total population of the Crimeanpeninsula. More than 230,000 people, including almost the entire Crimean Tatar population, were deported, mostly to Uzbekistan. Those who survived the deportation were only allowed to return after perestroika 45 years later. Even then, communist authorities gave them a hostile reception. But after 25 years in independent Ukraine, the Tatars had rebuilt their communities from scratch. They formed the only nation in the former Soviet Union with its own democratic governing body, the mejlis, with no help from the state. Thanks to this elected body and its long-time head, Mustafa Dzhemilev, a Soviet-era dissident, Crimean Tatars became semi-autonomous within Ukraine, while supporting the country\u2019s pro-European leanings. In 2014, the Tatars boycotted the sham and illegal referendum organised by Russia. The Kremlin hailed the result as a \u201cvote\u201d for Crimea to join the Russian Federation. This dissent kickstarted a new and brutal phase of Tatar oppression.\nToday, less than 300,000 people \u2013 below 15% of the peninsula\u2019s population \u2013 is Tatar. In the two years since annexation more than 21,000 Tatars have left because of an intensifying atmosphere of hatred and repression, and the exodus shows no signs of slowing. The nature of this repression is highlighted by the fact that more than 90% of those in prison in the region are accused of political crimes. A large majority of those declared missing since the annexation are from the Tatar community. Mejlis leaders such as Dzhemilev and Refat Chubarov, alongside other public figures and journalists of Tatar origin, have been forced to leave Crimea, prohibited from visiting their homeland by Russia. The first signs of the crackdown started in 2014, when Tatars were forbidden from holding mass gatherings, even on 18 May, the official day for commemorating the 1944 deportations. In spring 2015, the Russian authorities banned Tatar TV channels and press outlets. ATR, the Crimean Tatar TV channel, was closed down, as well as the radio station Meydan FM and even a children\u2019s TV channel, Lale. Since then, the situation has become increasingly dangerous, to the point that parents now accompany their children to school for fear of abduction. Young Tatar are even told not to wear clothes with ethnic elements. Last year, Nariman Jelyalov, the deputy president of the mejlis, published a personal safety manual, recommending Tatars only move around in groups in well-lit public places.\nIn order to maintain the atmosphere of fear among Tatars, Russian security forces \u2013 complete with dogs and armed masked men \u2013 have been conducting regular raids. People are fined, arrested and put on trial en masse for anything that reminds the Russian authorities of the existence of Crimean Tatars, from national flags to supposedly banned literature. Last month, the entire system of Crimean Tatar self-rule, comprising more than 2,000 elected delegates, was declared to be an extremist organisation by the supreme court of Russia, and participating members are now being threatened with incarceration for taking part in \u201cillegal gatherings\u201d. For his support for the territorial integrity of his country, Akhtem Chiygoz, the deputy chairman of the mejlis, has been in prison for 18 months, while Ilmi Umerov, a former head of the Bakhchisarai district administration, the ancient capital of the Crimean Tatars, was put in a psychiatric ward for a humiliating psychiatric examination. He was eventually found sane. There are now more than 20 Crimean Tatars in Russian prisons, and the number is steadily increasing. Others have faced kidnap, and even death. The most infamous abduction in Crimea happened in May, when a group of people in military uniforms abducted Ervin Ibragimov, one of the leaders of the World Congress of Crimean Tatars, in front of CCTV cameras. His fate is unknown. Many in the Tatar community presume he is dead. There are no barbed-wire fences in this new hybrid ghetto of Vladimir Putin\u2019s \u2013 yet. Instead of wire there is hate-filled TV propaganda, total surveillance and constant harassment.\nThe Tatars have been picked for the outcast role. Russian authorities in Crimea are busy erecting monuments to the persecutors of the Tatars: Stalin and Catherine the Great. Crimean Tatars are afraid to speak to journalists and human rights activists \u2013 and to each other. Meanwhile, their neighbours are busy writing reports to the authorities and want to know when the Tatars will get the hell out of \u201cour Russian Crimea\u201d. Crimean Tatars are banned from speaking their native language at work. If they use it outside their own areas people insult them. Parents from Russian and other non-Tatar families prefer to limit their and their children\u2019s contacts with Crimean Tatars. There is a tradition in \u201cRussian Crimea\u201d: military helicopters circle low above homes during raids carried out on dates that mark tragic events in Crimean Tatar history. They do it for no apparent reasons \u2013 just to make the windows shake. I do not know how many people in Crimea must be killed, driven out and deprived of human dignity before a world that once conquered fascism stands up and defends Crimean Tatars. The international community could, for example, introduce special sanctions to punish Russia for bringing Nazi practices back to Europe. I know that until that is done, the situation will become catastrophically worse. And in years to come, many will feel ashamed for staying silent today. Translated by Svetlana Graudt\n",

        "body": "Legal and constitutional questions have been raised over revelations that the Baltimore police department used privately contracted surveillance technology to secretly monitor vast swaths of the city, lawyers and civil liberties advocates say. The program, confirmed for the first time by police officials on Wednesday, allows a small plane to film a 32 square mile section of the city. The tape is saved and stored and analysts can move about in time and space in order to track vehicles or individuals, although individual human characteristics aren\u2019t discernible. Russ McNutt, the founder of the Ohio-based Persistent Surveillance, likened it to \u201cGoogle Earth with Tivo.\u201d\nThe Baltimore police department entered into a trial agreement with Persistent Surveillance in January and the company has filmed the city for 300 hours and provided the police department with over 100 investigative reports. According to Bloomberg BusinessWeek, which broke the story earlier this week, McNutt developed the program for the Pentagon in 2006 and in 2007 it was used in Iraq. Legal experts, struggling to catch up with a program that police just admitted exists, are questioning how these tactics will hold up in court. \u201cIt\u2019s highly intrusive surveillance,\u201d said Natalie Finegar, the deputy district public defender, whose office expressed outrage over the program, which was revealed two weeks after the Department of Justice issued a scathing report claiming that the department regularly violated the rights of citizens. Baltimore\u2019s police commissioner, Kevin Davis, said in a statement that the technology was a reasonable response to the city\u2019s extreme violence. \u201cAt a time when 84% of our homicides occur in outdoor public spaces, it seems logical to explore opportunities to capture the brazen killers who don\u2019t think twice about gunning down their victims on our streets,\u201d he said. And police spokesman TJ Smith said the technology has been central in several arrests. Finegar said arrests that relied on the surveillance could be subject to legal challenge. \u201c\u2018If you\u2019re walking down the street and see a blue light camera and it\u2019s been publicly discussed and there were hearings about it, then you understand that you could be being videotaped. But if you have a Cessna flying up out of sight on random days with a 32-mile radius, then it starts to become what legal analysts call \u2018aggregate data\u2019 and that has not been held up by some of the appellate courts.\u201d Shahid Buttar, a constitutional lawyer with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the law hasn\u2019t even yet \u201cevolved to reach these circumstances\u201d. \u201cThe court is only now grappling with these kinds of mass surveillance technologies, and the supreme court at least has never ruled on a case like this,\u201d said Buttar. \u201cIt\u2019s not the case that this is legal. It is the case that no court has had the chance to clearly declare it illegal yet.\u201d Jake Laperruque, a privacy fellow at the Constitution Project, said similar issues are now being litigated. \u201cThere\u2019s a strong case to be made, based on what the supreme court has said in the past, that there is a constitutional right to be free from pervasive location tracking without court authorization,\u201d he said. He added that, absent answers from the Baltimore police about when and how the surveillance technology is used, there \u201cdefinitely is potential for serious abuse\u201d. \u201cWhat\u2019s to say that the Baltimore police couldn\u2019t zoom in on a protest, on a religious ceremony, on an abortion clinic, or just to track people in an arbitrary or improper manner?\u201d he asked. Part of the problem with ascertaining illegality is that some of the most objectionable practices are being performed by the private company, Persistent Surveillance, and not the police themselves. It is staff of the company who fly the plane, review the tape, and provide reports to police. \u201cWhat the private company here is doing would be flatly illegal for the government to do,\u201d Buttar said, noting the irony of the company\u2019s name. \u201cPersistent surveillance has been held unconstitutional by the supreme court [in] US v Jones.\u201d \u201cWho owns the material is also important,\u201d Finegar said. \u201cDoes it belong to law enforcement or is this company now a state actor for purposes of discovery? Or are they going \u2026 to try to say that is not discoverable material, it\u2019s not in the hands of the state?\u201d Finegar faces a practical problem: her office has no way of knowing which cases the technology was used in or what role it played in an investigation. \u201cIt feels less like an investigative tool and like a potential for big brotherhood,\u201d Finegar said. \u201cIt really needs to be regulated and it needs to be openly discussed.\u201d It was the city public defender\u2019s office that uncovered earlier this year the details of the police department\u2019s use of another form of surveillance, Stingray technology, which uses cellphone data to locate individuals without a warrant. Last April, Maryland\u2019s second highest court ruled that using Stingray to obtain warrants was unconstitutional, calling into question hundreds of cases. The city council has said it will hold a hearing about the program next month. \u201cThe commissioner keeps talking about transparency, but every time we turn around, there\u2019s something else where we\u2019re left on the outside,\u201d councilman Warren Branch told the Baltimore Sun on Thursday.

        "body": "The New York City police department has violated several regulations in its surveillance of predominantly Muslim communities as recently as 2015, a report released on Thursday found. The 67-page report was completed by the NYPD\u2019s inspector general, and examined the police department\u2019s intelligence unit. The report found that, when examining political groups, investigators consistently failed to get proper authorization or timely extensions for investigations or the use of informants and undercover cops.\n\u201cThis investigation demonstrates a failure by NYPD to follow rules governing the timing and authorizations of surveillance of political activity,\u201d said Mark G Peters, commissioner of the department of investigations (DOI), a city-wide watchdog. NYPD\u2019s inspector general office is a part of the DOI and was only created two years ago following a law passed in the city council. NYPD\u2019s guidelines for investigating are dictated by the Handschu agreement, established 32 years ago following a class-action lawsuit filed by several political organizations that accused the NYPD of unconstitutional surveillance. \u201cThe Guidelines were designed to establish certain baseline controls on NYPD\u2019s considerable investigative power,\u201d the report explained. The office of the inspector general examined investigations that were closed between 2011 and 2015, some of which started as early as 2004. The number of reports the inspector general examined was redacted but in a footnote on the first page, the authors note that more than 95%of the individuals under investigation were Muslim and/or engaged in activity associated with Islam. \u201cI am deeply disturbed to learn that 95% of the sample investigative statements reviewed by the IG were Muslims or entities associated with Islam,\u201d said Linda Sarsour, executive director of the Arab American Association of New York. \u201cIs this a confirmation of a Muslim surveillance program?\u201d The findings troubled many activists in New York\u2019s Muslim community due to the NYPD\u2019s tumultuous history with Muslim American New Yorkers. In 2011, the department was revealed to have unconstitutionally infiltrated Muslim student groups, mosques, religious bookstores, hookah bars and other predominantly Muslim areas to spy on people. The demographics unit, which was responsible for the program, was dismantled in 2014. The original surveillance program sparked a series of lawsuits, one of which concluded earlier this year. In the settlement of the case of Raza v The City of New York \u2013 which is still subject to court approval \u2013 the NYPD agreed to several reforms including: requiring facts before an investigations is launched, limiting the use of informants and undercovers, and prohibiting investigations in which race, religion or ethnicity is a substantial motivating factor. Naz Ahmad, a staff attorney for Creating Law Enforcement Accountability & Responsibility (Clear) Project, which represented the plaintiffs in the case, welcomed the inspector general\u2019s findings. \u201cWe welcome the inspector general\u2019s report confirming what our clients have long known: that the NYPD\u2019s surveillance of American Muslims operated without oversight and often in violation of the rules,\u201d Ahmad said. The use of informants and undercover police, known as human sources, came under scrutiny in the report. Of the requests for human sources reviewed, none contained any details about the anticipated role of that source. It also criticized the use of \u201cboilerplate\u201d language when providing reasons for extending the use of informants. Preliminary inquiries, which allow the police to gather information even when no law has been been broken, were allowed to continue indefinitely, and 100% of the extensions reviewed by the office of the inspector general contained no reason for the extension. The report found the NYPD\u2019s intelligence unit would also routinely continue investigations even after legal authority had expired, which amounted to months of time over the course of investigations. The NYPD did not have any qualms with the findings of the report. \u201cI am very pleased the inspector general\u2019s audit has independently confirmed this to be true, and I thank the IG\u2019s office for its work on this audit and report,\u201d said outgoing police commissioner William J Bratton.\nFahd Ahmed, the executive director of Desis Rising Up & Moving (Drum), said the report confirms their suspicions and evidence. Drum conducted a survey of the Muslim community between 2011 and 2015 and found that surveillance by the NYPD was ongoing. \u201cThey might as well rename it the Muslim Investigations Department,\u201d Ahmed said.\n",

        "body": "Police in Vancouver have confirmed they made use of \u201cstingray\u201d surveillance technology at least once, in what is believed to be one of the first admissions by a municipal police force in Canada of using the controversial cellphone dragnet equipment. The revelation came after a year-long push by a coalition of civil rights organisations and Vancouver\u2019s Pivot Legal Society. In a recent letter to police, the groups asked Vancouver police two pointed questions: whether police had used stingray and if they would do so again. \u201cAnd they responded with yes and yes,\u201d said Micheal Vonn of the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association, who posted the answer on the organisation\u2019s blog earlier this week. Stingrays, also known as IMSI catchers or cell-site simulators, mimic cellphone towers in order to strip metadata, location information and, in some cases, content from phones that connect to them. Vancouver police confirmed to the Guardian that the device had been used in 2007 as an investigative tool in a suspected abduction that is now considered a possible homicide. The police force said it does not own the device and had made a request for assistance to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The request, it noted, was based on \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d and authorised by the RCMP. The stingray was not operated by the Vancouver police and was used in an attempt to locate or verify the presence of the specific cellphone owned by the person believed to have been abducted. Police in the western Canadian city had initially refused to confirm or deny the use of the device, leading to an inquiry by the province\u2019s privacy commissioner. The inquiry was scuttled after police agreed to comply with the request. Police then disclosed that they do not possess a stingray and have no records of using the device, sparking a back and forth with civil rights organisations. In responding to the police revelation, the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association noted the police force\u2019s use of stingray appeared legitimate, appropriate and authorised, but questions remain as to why there was no paper trail or policies and procedures in place to guide the use of the device. \u201cThere\u2019s no logical reason why there should be no documents in a case where there actually has been a usage,\u201d said Vonn. \u201cWe can only think that the desire has been to cover the tracks on that.\u201d In recent days the organisation has received phone calls from others across Canada wondering about how widespread the use of stingrays may be among municipal police forces. \u201cIf its available to the VPD then surely its available to other police forces that would make the request,\u201d said Vonn. \u201cSo the question is, have they done so? That would be an awful lot of digging, so we don\u2019t know.\u201d The use of stingrays by a growing list of federal agencies in the US has been widely documented, but little has been uncovered regarding their use in Canada. Much of what is known comes from a recent court case of a mafia murder in Qu\u00e9bec, during which the court heard the RCMP had been using the device in Canada for more than a decade. Court documents detailed testimony from one officer who spoke of personally operating stingrays in 30 different operations and on 50 different subjects. Another said the RCMP was maintaining a large facility in an undisclosed location where it tested stingrays and developed methodologies. \u201cOur best guess is that municipal police departments can apply to the RCMP for use of them,\u201d said Vonn. The British Columbia Civil Liberties Association is among several group calling on the Canadian government to regulate the use of the devices, pointing to the lack of policy currently surrounding the use of the device despite more than a decade of use. \u201cNot only has it taken years to get the most basic and partial information on this subject,\u201d said Vonn, \u201cbut we are still largely dependent on the goodwill of the police to use these devices responsibly, because protection from illegitimate or abusive use is next to nil.\u201d\n",

Asked at the first public hearing into Trump\u2019s ties to Russia whether he, or anyone else, had asked GCHQ to spy on Trump or his allies, Rogers replied: \u201cNo, sir, nor would I.\u201d GCHQ took rare public exception last week when the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, cited a Fox News report that implied Barack Obama\u2019s administration had asked the UK to conduct surveillance on Trump. GCHQ, which typically does not comment on news reports, called the accusation \u201cnonsense\u201d, \u201cutterly ridiculous\u201d and an assertion that ought to be \u201cignored\u201d. Rogers, his voice passionate, said that using GCHQ to effectively launder illegal surveillance on Americans would be \u201cagainst the Five Eyes concept\u201d.\nFive Eyes is the surveillance alliance between the US, UK, New Zealand, Canada and Australia, which include widespread intelligence sharing and mutual development of surveillance tools. GCHQ in particular is the closest intelligence partner the NSA possesses. NSA and GCHQ personnel share code, and, in several locations, physically work side by side. Their intimate nature was underscored by Rogers\u2019 deputy, Rick Ledgett, telling the BBC that the accusation showed an ignorance of the GCHQ-NSA partnership. \u201cOf course they wouldn\u2019t do it. It would be epically stupid,\u201d Ledgett said. Spicer recycled the GCHQ allegation, made by a Fox News pundit, in order to defend Trump\u2019s 4 March accusation, made on Twitter, that Obama placed Trump\u2019s associates under surveillance at Trump Tower. Obama has unequivocally denied the accusation, which, if proven, would mean that he had committed a felony. The FBI director, James Comey, on Monday publicly called the accusation groundless, the first time he has commented on the explosive accusation. Comey joined the Republican and Democratic leadership of the intelligence committees in finding no basis for Trump\u2019s incendiary claim.\nYet Trump has still not backed away from the accusation of GCHQ surveillance on him, even after GCHQ expressed its anger. Trump, in a White House press conference meeting last week with Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel, said he was merely citing Fox News. Trump joked that he and Merkel, whom the NSA had indeed spied upon, had something in common. That remark prompted Sir Peter Westmacott, former British ambassador to Washington, to accuse Trump of \u201cpeddling falsehoods\u201d. \u201cThis is a dangerous game,\u201d Westmacott wrote in the Guardian. \u201cThe intelligence relationship between Britain and America is unique and precious. It is critical to our shared efforts to counter terrorism.\u201d Asked by the House intelligence committee whether the false assertions might damage the intelligence-sharing relationship, Rogers, the NSA chief said: \u201cIt clearly frustrates allies of ours.\u201d\n",

The New York Public Library (NYPL) changed its privacy policy on Wednesday to emphasize its data-collection policies. Last week, the NYPL website stated that \u201cany library record or other information collected by the Library as described herein is subject to disclosure pursuant to subpoena, court order, or as otherwise authorized by applicable law\u201d. Now, the page reads: \u201cSometimes the law requires us to share your information, such as if we receive a valid subpoena, warrant, or court order. We may share your information if our careful review leads us to believe that the law, including state privacy law applicable to Library Records, requires us to do so.\u201d The NYPL also assures users that it will not retain data any longer than is necessary. \u201cWe are committed to keeping such information, outlined in all the examples above, only as long as needed in order to provide Library services,\u201d the librarians wrote. Meanwhile the digital library Archive.org, which keeps a searchable database of public websites, announced on Tuesday that it would create a new Canada-based backup of its huge information repository in order to respond to the increased threat of invisible government scrutiny. The group\u2019s services include the Internet Archive and a search engine cataloguing it, called the Wayback Machine. \u201cWe have statements by President Trump saying he\u2019s against net neutrality and he wants to expand libel laws,\u201d Archive.org founder Brewster Kahle told the Guardian. Librarians are wary of storing hoards of precious information \u201calong faultlines\u201d, whether those faultlines were literal or ideological. Trump has called for surveillance of Muslims and nominated Jeff Sessions as his attorney general; the Alabama senator called plans to stop the NSA\u2019s warrantless domestic wiretapping \u201cidiotic\u201d. Archive\u2019s director of partnerships, Wendy Hanamura, said the decision had been a sober one. \u201cWe didn\u2019t pick Canada out of a hat,\u201d she said. \u201cLaw in Canada has shifted recently, making it a really great place for libraries to experiment.\u201d \u201cEven before the election we had made the decision to host at least Canadian materials in Canada,\u201d Kahle said. \u201cThey have rigorous privacy rules because they don\u2019t particularly like patients\u2019 privacy information going to the United States.\u201d The response to the fundraising campaign had been overwhelming, he said. The Wayback is a popular tool among journalists; one of its key features is the ability to see what changes were made to a given website and when. The project automatically captures some 300m web pages every week and devotes some of its resources to splitting its archived material into collections of similar material, such as political ads and books in the public domain.\nBacklash from the librarian community to Trump\u2019s election was so rapid that the American Library Association (ALA) issued an apology for its 18 November statement, saying its members would \u201cwork with President-elect Trump\u201d and his transition team. \u201cWe understand that content from these press releases, including the 11/18/16 release that was posted in error, was interpreted as capitulating to and normalizing the incoming administration,\u201d the ALA president, Julie B Todaro, wrote in American Libraries Magazine. Todaro said that the ALA\u2019s core values remained unchanged: \u201cfree access, intellectual freedom, privacy and confidentiality\u201d. \u201cIt is clear that many of these values are at odds with messaging or positions taken by the incoming administration,\u201d she wrote.\n",

        "body": "A pack of drones whizzed across Governor\u2019s Island against the backdrop of the Manhattan skyline. About the size of a plate, they whipped through the track of the second annual National Drone Racing Championship, piloted by racers in goggles standing a few yards away. Friday was a practice day at the drone race, a sport that\u2019s still in its infancy. But this weekend\u2019s event is its big moment. For the first time in drone racing\u2019s short existence, the competition will be broadcast on ESPN. \u201cWe\u2019re all really excited to have something to crown the industry and show what this is all about,\u201d said competitor Zoe Stumbaugh, who began drone racing about two years ago. But the cameras also add a degree of pressure. \u201cIs it going to be a huge sport that explodes or is something else going to happen to it?\u201d Ken Loo, Stumbaugh\u2019s team-mate on team AirVuz, said. \u201cThis is the first televised event where a big network is picking up the coverage, so it\u2019s gotta go well.\u201d The national championships, hosted by the Drone Sports Association and sponsored by GoPro, will be broadcast live on ESPN3, the network\u2019s online channel, and as a package on one of its cable channels. The event can also be watched live for free. Stumbaugh, Loo and about 100 mostly male fellow competitors, known as pilots, arrived with multiple X-shaped quadcopters dangling off their backpacks or carrying winged, plane-like drones for the event. Participants of all ages came from around the country toting their gear. Sorell Miller, 12, and his father, Conrad, 37, came from Boise, Idaho, for the event. The pair recently joined the same team as Stumbaugh and Loo and have a bit of a rivalry. \u201cI\u2019m always trying to beat him,\u201d Miller said of his father. He beat his father in his first race in Oregon last week, the pair said. Pilots can participate in four events \u2013 an individual race, team relay, freestyle and flying wing. The actual competition takes place on Saturday and Sunday, while Friday was spent checking equipment and setting up video feeds. Practice commenced late on Friday afternoon. Racers stood under a tent in the center of the track wearing first-person view (FPV) goggles that enabled them to see out of the cameras on their drones. Controllers in hand, they sped their small drones through large hooped obstacles. The drones raced for about three minutes \u2013 as long as their batteries allowed \u2013 with a 60mph speed limit. Crashes are infrequent but painful \u2013 Loo said \u201cit\u2019s like his baby going down\u201d. Other pilots followed along through their own goggles or on sometimes-shaky video screens.\nDrone Sports Association chairman Scot Refsland walked through the course with pilots beforehand, explaining its U-shape and vertical as well as horizontal obstacles. Weather will be another obstacle \u2013 as wind whipped through the track, knocking down a hoop. Rain is expected for the weekend, but an event official said they built time into the schedule to wait for bad weather to pass. Refsland emphasized that the race wants to be \u201cspectator friendly\u201d \u2013 a challenge for the small, fast-moving sport \u2013 and that they\u2019ll bring the action as close to the live audience as possible. To the side of the track was a VIP tent and some bleachers to watch. The first national drone racing championship at the California state fair last year had only a handful of spectators, according to Quartz. But Stumbaugh said she thought a crowd would show up for the races this weekend, since the event was promoted more. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazingly huge event with the best pilots in the US,\u201d she said. As a mark of the sport\u2019s increasing popularity, the Drone Sports Association is one of multiple leagues that have formed around the sport. The Drone Racing League, by contrast, doesn\u2019t aim to have spectators, but rather compiles a video package of its races. Last year\u2019s competition in Dubai was particularly high stakes, with a prize of $1m. This event winner will go on to compete in an international tournament staged by the Drone Sports Association in Hawaii later this year. Loo and Stumbaugh are two of the many racers with a moderate social media presence, as YouTube and Instagram have become even more important to its livelihood. Loo said he never used social media until he built his first drone in 2014. He said he uses the platforms for promoting sponsors and getting the word out about drone racing. \u201cI want this to become an everybody hobby,\u201d Stumbaugh said. She praised the sport\u2019s accessibility for all types. She built her first drone after being bedridden due to a medical condition and said flying a drone was \u201cthe most enabling thing\u201d she had ever done. \u201cIt was an instant turnaround from being depressed, stuck in bed, to I can fly free,\u201d Stumbaugh said. \u201cThis is the only sport where its a really even playing field. If you have thumbs and eyeballs, you can fly a drone,\u201d she added.\n",

        "body": "Think of it, to use the ingenious phrase coined by my colleague John Harris, as \u201cStasi capitalism\u201d. That might sound like an overreaction to the announcement of a new car insurance scheme, but hear me out. Admiral has publicised a new service \u2013 firstcarquote \u2013 which it hopes will analyse the Facebook posts of first-time car owners, looking for evidence that they\u2019re the kind of well-organised, conscientious types who will be safe on the roads. (It\u2019s still a hope at this stage after Facebook appeared to call a halt to the scheme just two hours before launch.) If you use a calendar or bookkeeping apps, tend to write in short, coherent sentences and use lots of lists, you\u2019ll look like a safe bet and might qualify for a discount. But if your social media history is chock-full of exclamation marks, with a heavy use of \u201calways\u201d and \u201cnever\u201d rather than the more cautious \u201cmaybe\u201d, that might suggest you\u2019re a tad on the over-confident, even reckless side \u2013 and you\u2019ll have to pay the full rate. Admiral is hardly the first company to seek to exploit the data we generate about ourselves this way. As today\u2019s Guardian report points out, the health and life insurer Vitality is willing to sell you an Apple Watch at a discounted price \u2013 just so long as you let the company keep an eye on how many steps you\u2019re doing and it decides you\u2019re getting enough exercise. If that strikes you as sinister, there\u2019s a good reason. You only have to have read a little dystopian science fiction to know that human beings have an aversion to being watched by machines \u2013 and an even greater aversion to being judged by them. It was bad enough when it slowly dawned on people, the young especially, that their social media history could well be examined when they applied for a job or place at university. Whatever they put on their CV or r\u00e9sum\u00e9, a quick Google would reveal another, potentially more damning, picture. With that came the realisation that an active presence on social media came at the cost of privacy, that it was no longer possible to have a past that remained in the past, that even a minor episode of adolescent misbehaviour could live on \u2013 and have consequences. But at least in those situations there was the consolation that any decision would be taken by a human being. The university or potential employer could look at your Facebook posts and judge them \u2013 and you \u2013 in the round. There will be no such discretion from \u2013 or right of appeal to \u2013 Admiral\u2019s algorithm. Of course, the company is oozing reassurance: it will be voluntary, it\u2019s only for first-timers, it\u2019ll only affect discounts not the basic price. But you\u2019ll be forgiven for being sceptical. When everyone who agrees to being data-analysed qualifies for a cheaper rate, then the one who refuses \u2013 or fails the social media test \u2013 will, in effect, be paying a premium. The semantics may say otherwise, but that will be the reality. And if it works, of course its use will spread. In a way, the Vitality case is the more troubling. As it stands, the Apple Watch scheme is just a clever way to incentivise exercise. But it will be very tempting for health insurers to start using the data they\u2019ve picked up electronically from their customers to set their rates for basic healthcare coverage: higher premiums for those revealed to be taking the lifts rather than using the stairs. In the UK, where we have the NHS that may not be such a terrifying prospect. But in the US, where companies can deny you health insurance or charge unaffordable premiums, your social media profile could make a life-changing difference. In the old days, intrusive, all-seeing surveillance was associated with the state. Governments are still watching us, of course. But these days Big Brother is just as likely to be a big corporation; today\u2019s Stasi agent is the phone in your pocket. What\u2019s worse, it\u2019s you who put him there \u2013 and told him everything he knows. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 November 2016 as the launch of firstcarquote was halted just before it was due to launch.

        "body": "Reaction by privacy campaigners and others to Friday\u2019s landmark ruling that GCHQ\u2019s mass surveillance was unlawful contrasts sharply with that of the intelligence agency itself.\nWhile a GCHQ spokesperson insisted the ruling by Britain\u2019s Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) found against the authorities only \u201cin one small respect\u201d, Privacy International said the decision had \u201cvindicated\u201d the actions of Edward Snowden, the former US National Security Agency (NSA) whistleblower whose revelations led to the IPT investigation. Downing Street said the judgment \u2013 which found that GCHQ\u2019s access to intercepted information obtained by the NSA breached human rights law until the end of last year \u2013 did not require GCHQ to change its operations. GCHQ spokesperson We are pleased that the court has once again ruled that the UK\u2019s bulk interception regime is fully lawful. It follows the court\u2019s clear rejection of accusations of \u2018mass surveillance\u2019 in their December judgment. The IPT has, however, found against the government in one small respect in relation to the historic intelligence-sharing legal regime. The court has ruled that the public disclosure of two paragraphs of additional detail, voluntarily disclosed by the government during the litigation, were essential to make the public regime sufficiently foreseeable and therefore fully compatible with the European convention on human rights. They found that to the extent that these two paragraphs were not previously in the public domain, the intelligence-sharing regime prior to that point was in contravention of human rights law. But the judgment does not in any way suggest that important safeguards protecting privacy were not in place at all relevant times. It does not require GCHQ to change what it does to protect national security in any way. Today\u2019s IPT ruling reaffirms that the processes and safeguards within the intelligence-sharing regime were fully adequate at all times \u2013 it is simply about the amount of detail about those processes and safeguards that needed to be in the public domain. We welcome the important role the IPT has played in ensuring that the public regime is sufficiently detailed. By its nature, much of GCHQ\u2019s work must remain secret. But we are working with the rest of government to improve public understanding about what we do and the strong legal and policy framework that underpins all our work. We continue to do what we can to place information safely into the public domain that can help to achieve this. James Welch, legal director for Liberty We now know that, by keeping the public in the dark about their secret dealings with the NSA, GCHQ acted unlawfully and violated our rights. That their activities are now deemed lawful is thanks only to the degree of disclosure Liberty and the other claimants were able to force from our secrecy-obsessed government. But the intelligence services retain a largely unfettered power to rifle through millions of people\u2019s private communications \u2013 and the tribunal believes the limited safeguards revealed during last year\u2019s legal proceedings are an adequate protection of our privacy. We disagree, and will be taking our fight to the European court of human rights. Eric King, deputy director of Privacy International For far too long, intelligence agencies like GCHQ and NSA have acted like they are above the law. Today\u2019s decision confirms to the public what many have said all along: over the past decade, GCHQ and the NSA have been engaged in an illegal mass surveillance sharing programme that has affected millions of people around the world. We must not allow agencies to continue justifying mass surveillance programmes using secret interpretations of secret laws. The world owes Edward Snowden a great debt for blowing the whistle, and today\u2019s decision is a vindication of his actions. But more work needs to be done. The only reason why the NSA-GCHQ sharing relationship is still legal today is because of a last-minute clean-up effort by government to release previously secret \u201carrangements\u201d. That is plainly not enough to fix what remains a massive loophole in the law, and we hope that the European court decides to rule in favour of privacy rather than unchecked state power. Elizabeth Knight, legal director at Open Rights Group This ruling is a very welcome first step. It shows that secret policies are not an acceptable basis for highly intrusive intelligence sharing practices. However, the IPT has not gone far enough. These flimsy policies are not enough to comply with the requirements of human rights law, even now they are public. And GCHQ\u2019s own Tempora programme of mass interception is clearly both unlawful and disproportionate. We hope the European court of human rights will go further than the IPT and find that mass surveillance breaches our human right to privacy. Cori Crider, director, Reprieve After a decade and a half of siding with the government, it is welcome that the IPT is beginning to hold our spies to account. But stark problems with the UK\u2019s surveillance system remain: for years the government has written itself a blank cheque to eavesdrop on confidential communications between lawyers and clients, even in cases where the government itself is in the dock. This is totally unfair and undermines the core premise of our legal system. Downing Street spokeswoman The overall judgment this morning is that the UK\u2019s interception regime is fully lawful. That follows on from the court\u2019s clear rejection of accusations of mass surveillance in their December judgment, and we welcome that. It\u2019s important to be clear that the overall interception regime and bulk interception they found fully, fully lawful, and that it was compliant with the right to privacy at all times. What they said was, on the legal framework governing that, that there should be more about the rules that should be disclosed publicly. I think it was two paragraphs of additional detail, and the government did that during the proceedings. They are not questioning in this judgment that the safeguarding of privacy was in any way jeopardised and the judgment will not require GCHQ to change what it does. The spokeswoman added that the prime minister believes the government should make sure the intelligence agencies \u201ccontinue to have the powers they need to keep us safe\u201d. On Twitter, the longer term consequences of the ruling were seized upon.

        "body": "British intelligence officials have denied an allegation that the UK helped former president Barack Obama \u201cwiretap\u201d Donald Trump during the 2016 election. The claim was repeated by the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, on Thursday and dismissed as \u201cutterly ridiculous\u201d by a GCHQ spokesperson. The spokesperson added in a statement: \u201cRecent allegations made by media commentator judge Andrew Napolitano about GCHQ being asked to conduct \u2018wiretapping\u2019 against the then president-elect are nonsense. They are utterly ridiculous and should be ignored.\u201d\nThis week, Napolitano, Fox News judicial analyst, claimed during an interview on the network that three intelligence sources confirmed to him that the Obama administration used GCHQ to spy on Trump so that there would be \u201cno American fingerprints on this\u201d. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, quoted Napolitano\u2019s allegation in an effort to validate Trump\u2019s unfounded claim that Obama tapped his phones last year.\nBritish and American intelligence agencies cooperate closely. Along with their counterparts from Australia, New Zealand and Canada, they are members of the Five Eyes, which all work together on intelligence. According to documents released by the whistleblower Edward Snowden, British officials allowed their US counterparts to store and analyse British citizens\u2019 internet and email records. And Snowden also revealed that America\u2019s National Security Agency paid \u00a3100m to GCHQ in secret. Tim Farron, leader of the Liberal Democrats \u2013 the junior partner in the last British coalition government \u2013 said Trump was \u201ccompromising the vital UK-US security relationship to try to cover his own embarrassment\u201d. Trump started the political firestorm in a series of tweets in early March, when he accused Obama of tapping his phones and called his predecessor a \u201cbad (or sick) guy\u201d. US officials called the allegation groundless.\n\u201cTerrible! Just found out that Obama had my \u2018wires tapped\u2019 in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!\u201d Trump tweeted on 4 March. The president finds himself increasingly alone in his defence of his wiretapping claims. On Thursday, the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate intelligence committee joined their counterparts on the House intelligence committee in the conclusion that they had seen no evidence to support the president\u2019s accusation. During the briefing, Spicer said Trump \u201cstands by it\u201d and emphasised, as he has attempted to do in recent days, that the president was referring broadly to wiretapping as a range of surveillance-related activities. Trump made a similar argument in a Wednesday night interview on Fox News, telling the interview host, Tucker Carlson, that the word wiretap \u201ccovers surveillance and many other things\u201d. He also told Carlson that the administration would submit evidence of his claim to the House intelligence panel \u201cvery soon\u201d, adding: \u201cYou\u2019re going to find some very interesting items coming to the forefront over the next two weeks.\u201d In the same interview, he wrongly cited a New York Times report in January about intercepted communications and financial records concerning Trump associates and Russian officials as supporting his claim. Asked why he had not relied on US intelligence for a claim with extraordinary legal implications, Trump offered a quixotic reply: \u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to do anything that\u2019s going to violate any strength of an agency.\u201d\n",

        "body": "GCHQ, Britain\u2019s national security surveillance agency, has been ordered to destroy legally privileged communications it unlawfully collected from a Libyan rendition victim. The ruling marks the first time in its 15-year history that the investigatory powers tribunal has upheld a specific complaint against the intelligence services, lawyers have said. It is also the first time the tribunal has ordered a security service to give up surveillance material. The IPT says GCHQ must destroy two documents which are legally privileged communications belonging to a former opponent of the Gaddafi regime, Sami al-Saadi, who was sent back to Libya in 2004 in a joint MI6-CIA \u201crendition\u201d operation with his wife and four children under 12. The tribunal, chaired by Mr Justice Burton, ruled that GCHQ must give an undertaking that parts of those documents must be \u201cdestroyed or deleted so as to render such information inaccessible to the agency in the future\u201d. The agency has to submit a secret report within 14 days confirming that the destruction has been carried out. GCHQ has also been ordered to hand over a hard copy of the papers to the interception of communications commissioner within seven days. They will be kept safe for five years in case there are further legal proceedings or an inquiry. The tribunal says that although the two documents contain information covered by legal privilege they did not disclose or refer to any legal advice: \u201cThe tribunal, after careful consideration, is [also] satisfied that there was no use or disclosure of the privileged information for the purpose of defending the civil claim brought by [Saadi] and others.\u201d This is a compensation claim against Jack Straw, the then foreign secretary, and the Foreign Office, being brought by Saadi along with another prominent opponent of Gaddafi, Abdel Hakim Belhaj and his family, for their role in their rendition and subsequent torture in Libya in 2004. The tribunal said that it would not order compensation in this case as the material involved had not been disclosed to any lawyer or policy officials working on the main case and was of no significant value. The tribunal made a \u201cno determination\u201d ruling in eight other claims brought by Belhaj and other members of the Saadi family that legally privileged material had been unlawfully accessed by GCHQ involving their rendition cases. In February, the government, anticipating this ruling, admitted that the policies and procedures governing the handling of legally privileged material had been unlawful for the past five years because they had not made public safeguards necessary to make them compliant with human rights legislation. Exchanges between lawyers and their clients enjoy a special level of legal protection. The judges declined to award compensation to Saadi, saying the declaration in February and the determination was sufficient satisfaction for those who brought the case. They also rejected a request that the material be handed over to them rather than destroyed, saying such a move might give an indication of how GCHQ obtained the information in the first place or enable those who were legitimate surveillance targets to take counter-measures. Cori Crider, of the campaign group Reprieve and counsel to the Saadi and Belhaj families, said: \u201cGCHQ spied on privileged legal communications in a case where they were being sued by a rendition and torture victim. We are pleased that one man has finally beaten the security services in this secretive tribunal. But this kind of illegal snooping makes phone hacking look like child\u2019s play, because it rigs the whole justice game in the government\u2019s favour. \u201cIt\u2019s also inconceivable that Mr al-Saadi was spied on while Mr Belhaj was not. I confess I find this part of the IPT\u2019s decision very difficult to make sense of.\u201d Saadi said: \u201cI am glad to be the first person to win against the spies in this tribunal. I had always been told I had a right to communicate with my lawyers about this torture case in private, but that clearly wasn\u2019t the case. This was illegal behavior and I hope now that the right to take legal advice in private will never be ignored again.\u201d A government spokesman said: \u201cThe government welcomes the tribunal\u2019s confirmation today that the intelligence agencies did not seek or gain any advantage in legal proceedings, nor held information referring to any legal advice relating to the claimants. \u201cThe government published a revised code of practice in February 2015 to provide increased safeguards for handling legally privileged material. The agencies are working with the interception of communications commissioner to ensure that their policies meet the required standard.\u201d Crider said the decision represented a further encroachment on the security services\u2019 secrecy doctrine of \u201cneither confirming, nor denying\u201d their activities: \u201cIt blows the government\u2019s \u2018neither confirm nor deny\u2019 position out of the water,\u201d she said. \u201cThe tribunal have told Mr Al-Saadi that he was subject to spying, and it was illegal, in public. It adopts the sensible approach that whilst some spying operations may need to be kept secret, there is no good reason to hide unlawful conduct, which must be exposed.\u201d\n",

But in the end, only three people proved to be almost a match for Britain\u2019s finest cryptographers. While no one got all the possible answers correct, three men came the closest to fully solving the series of challenges set by GCHQ director Robert Hannigan in his Christmas card.\nThe compendium of word and number puzzles took a team of eight GCHQ cryptographers two months to compile and included subjects as diverse as knowledge of phonetics, semaphore, French, snooker and The Lord of the Rings. The cryptographers chose the three winners based on the quality of their reasoning. GCHQ admitted on Thursday that one of the questions contained an accidental misprint, making it even trickier. The three winners will receive a GCHQ paperweight and a copy of the biography of Bletchley Park codebreaker Alan Turing, signed with a personal message from Hannigan, as well as \u201cmajor bragging rights\u201d. David McBryan, 41, originally from Dublin but now living in Edinburgh, was one of the winners. He described it as \u201ca very well-constructed set of puzzles\u201d that were enjoyable but tough. \u201cI thought I had solved it, but a news report came out a few days ago saying nobody had \u2026 so I went back and had another look and figured out what I missed, but I was too late at that point. But it seems that everyone else missed it as well and I was joint closest,\u201d he said.\nMcBryan, a former winner of the TV game show Fifteen to One who now writes questions for the show, studied maths and artificial intelligence at university. He said \u201clogical rigorous thinking\u201d was needed to be a good puzzle-solver, but that experience was key: \u201cThe more you do the better you\u2019ll get at it.\u201d GCHQ denied that the puzzle was a recruitment ploy, but said the winners were welcome to apply for jobs. One of the cryptographers said the team initially feared the challenge would be too difficult. \u201cWe really didn\u2019t know whether it would be half a dozen people having a go so it was really difficult to judge how hard to make it,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact when tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of people were actually looking at it we were really surprised.\u201d The first stage was a grid-shading exercise which, when completed, revealed a scannable QR code to direct people to the next part. They then had to work out URLs and IP addresses through solving a series of clues until they reached the final stage. McBryan said: \u201cOnce you got through there\u2019s no confirmation whether you\u2019re on the right track or whether you got the right set of answers and that\u2019s one of the most frustrating aspects of it. So you need to be fairly obsessive to keep plugging away at it and trying different things. \u201cFor a long time after I got all the solutions I was still looking for more because you\u2019ve got no idea if you\u2019ve got it all.\u201d The full solution can be viewed on the GCHQ website [pdf].\n",

It passed its third reading by 444 votes to 69 and now goes to the Lords for further consideration. Their lordships will do their best \u2013 and they are good at scrutinising complex legislation \u2013 but sometime in the next parliamentary session the bill, substantially unchanged, will receive the royal assent and become law. As a result, the powers of the national security state will have been significantly expanded.\nAs an example of legislative cunning, the bill is a machiavellian masterpiece. Starting from the premise \u2013 obvious to the meanest intelligence \u2013 that the rat\u2019s nest of existing laws governing surveillance, interception of communications etc was intolerable, it purported to create a clean sheet in which all the powers of the secret state would be brought under one statute. And it appeared to take on board many of the criticisms levelled at the aforementioned rat\u2019s nest by three major independent reviews. It brought some of the activities of the security services that had hitherto been conducted under the dubious auspices of the 1984 Telecommunications Act under explicit statutory control. It threw in artfully obscurantist provisions (eg something called internet connection records) that were designed to get privacy activists stirred up, much as one might throw bits of offal to distract a pack of menacing dogs. And then, under cover of the resulting fuss, it slipped in authorisation of a massive extension of intrusive state power under the banal heading of \u201cequipment interference\u201d. In plain English, \u201cequipment interference\u201d is authorised hacking. It\u2019s what the security services have been doing covertly for ages without, as far as I can see, explicit legal authorisation. It is defined (in the code of practice accompanying the bill) as \u201ca range of techniques used by the equipment interference agencies that may be used to obtain communications, equipment data or other information from the equipment. The material so obtained may be used evidentially or as intelligence, or in some cases, may be used to test, maintain or develop equipment interference capabilities.\u201d\nWhat it means is anything from penetrating computer systems by covertly installing malware (viruses, trojans etc) on to them, using keyloggers to monitor every keystroke, tapping into cables, installing malware on smartphones and so on. If you and I were to try our hand at this kind of \u201cinterference\u201d, we would be contravening the Computer Misuse Act and be liable to be detained at her majesty\u2019s pleasure. When our spooks do it, therefore, they have to be protected from such unpleasant consequences, which is what part five of the investigatory powers bill is intended to provide. Two kinds of hacking are authorised by the bill \u2013 \u201ctargeted\u201d and \u201cbulk\u201d. Both require warrants and a fairly robust authorisation process. Targeted interference seems relatively unproblematic: if the spooks or cops have good reason to suspect an individual, then it\u2019s appropriate to allow them to bug said individual using whatever ingenious means are appropriate. Bulk interference, however, is a very different matter. The grounds for doing it are threefold: national security; preventing or detecting serious crime; and threats to \u201cthe economic well-being of the UK\u201d. So it\u2019s externally focused. But essentially it gives GCHQ & co a licence to hack into any device or network anywhere on the planet if they can persuade the home secretary to sign a warrant to authorise it.\nThe most worrying aspect of this, however, is that any company served with an equipment interference warrant not only has to assist the authorities in implementing it, but is also legally bound not to disclose that fact \u2013 to anyone. So imagine, for a moment, that you run a plucky British startup offering cybersecurity products and services. Given how insecure the online world is (see, for example, the recent catastrophic attack on the Swift banking system), many of your most lucrative customers will be overseas banks, some of whose customers may well be of interest to GCHQ or HMRC. But if you are served with an equipment interference warrant, you will have to comply and keep your mouth shut. When you tender for foreign business, therefore, guess what happens? Your foreign competitors will claim that your stuff probably has a backdoor in it installed by UK authorities. And your indignant denials will be greeted with cynical amusement, because foreigners aren\u2019t daft \u2013 and they can read the investigatory powers bill, too. So here we have a government, whose chancellor recently declared his firm determination to \u201csupport the best cyber startups\u201d, who is nevertheless pushing through legislation that seems designed to undermine the international credibility of said startups. Strange way to run a country, eh? But that\u2019s the national security state for you.\n",

        "body": "MPs\u2019 and peers\u2019 private communications are not protected from interception by the so-called Wilson doctrine that was widely thought to provide special privileges for parliamentarians, according to a court ruling. A surprise decision by the investigatory powers tribunal (IPT) has found that guarantees \u2013 which even the home secretary, Theresa May, reasserted this week \u2013 do not apply. The ruling prompted emergency questions in parliament and calls from MPs for statements by both the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, and the government. The investigatory powers tribunal judgment is in response to a claim brought by two Green party parliamentarians: Caroline Lucas, MP for Brighton Pavilion, and Jenny Jones. They had complained that disclosures by the whistleblower Edward Snowden made it clear that GCHQ was capturing their communications, in breach of the so-called Wilson doctrine.\nThe convention is named after former prime minister Harold Wilson, who pledged in 1966 that MPs\u2019 and peers\u2019 phones would not be tapped. He told the Commons \u201cthat there was to be no tapping of the telephones of members of parliament ... [but] that, if there was any development which required a change in the general policy, [he] would at such moment as seemed compatible with the security of the country, on [his] own initiative, make a statement in the house about it\u201d. In December 1997, the then prime minister, Tony Blair, said the doctrine extended to electronic communication, including emails. As recently as Monday, May told MPs: \u201cThe Wilson doctrine applies, but of course it is subject to proceedings that are taking place at the moment.\u201d In its decision, however, the tribunal said it was \u201csatisfied that the Wilson doctrine is not enforceable in English law\u201d, and that it was merely \u201ca political statement in a political context, encompassing the ambiguity that is sometimes to be found in political statements\u201d. The investigatory powers tribunal judgment said: \u201cThe Wilson doctrine does not operate so as to create a substantive legitimate expectation. \u201cThe Wilson doctrine has no legal effect but in practice the [intelligence] agencies must comply with the draft code and with their own guidance. The regime for the interception of parliamentarians\u2019 communications is in accordance with the law. \u201cMPs\u2019 communications with their constituents and others are protected, like those of every other person, by the statutory regime established by part one of Ripa [Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act] 2000. Unlike journalists\u2019 and lawyers\u2019 communications, there is no [European court of human rights] authority for enhanced protection for parliamentarians. \u201cThe Wilson doctrine, as now enunciated and put into effect, highlights a need for caution and circumspection in respect of parliamentarians\u2019 communications. But such caution and circumspection will be called for in respect of many other types of confidential and sensitive private communications, which come to be considered under the interception regimes.\u201d The finding is also surprising in the way it brushes aside assumed parliamentary privileges. Had the European court of human rights reached such a conclusion, Conservative MPs would have lined up to denounce Strasbourg\u2019s interference in domestic affairs. The judgment did not deal with the issue of whether MPs\u2019 or peers\u2019 email or phones had actually been monitored but dealt solely with whether the Wilson doctrine granted them special immunity from surveillance. The case was also brought by the former MP George Galloway. The Labour MP Sadiq Khan, whose conversations with a prisoner in a jail were bugged in 2005, was deemed by the then surveillance commissioner not to have been protected by the Wilson doctrine. Lucas said on Wednesday: \u201cThis judgment is a body-blow for parliamentary democracy. My constituents have a right to know that their communications with me aren\u2019t subject to blanket surveillance \u2013 yet this ruling suggests that they have no such protection. \u201cParliamentarians must be a trusted source for whistleblowers and those wishing to challenge the actions of the government. That\u2019s why upcoming legislation on surveillance must include a provision to protect the communications of MPs, peers, MSPs, AMs and MEPs from extra-judicial spying.\u201d Lady Jones said: \u201cAs parliamentarians who often speak to whistleblowers \u2013 from campaigners whose groups have been infiltrated by the police to those exposing corruption in government departments \u2013 this judgment is deeply worrying. \u201cOur job is to hold the executive to account, and to do that effectively it\u2019s crucial that people feel they can contact us without their communications being monitored. In a democracy there is absolute no excuse for people who contact parliamentarians to be subject to blanket surveillance by the security services.\u201d Lucas and Jones are now calling on the government to include specific protections for MPs and peers in upcoming legislation on surveillance. No 10 welcomed the court ruling and denied that the Wilson doctrine had misled MPs by giving the impression that their phone and email exchanges were protected from the British security services when in reality they were not. It insisted that the intelligence services understood they could only use their powers to tap phones in a proportionate way, and there were safeguards in place. Downing Street described the Wilson doctrine first expressed in 1966 as a political statement, without legal force, and pointed out that the intelligence agencies might be monitoring an individual who was in contact with an MP. It refused to say whether any MPs\u2019 phones, either at Westminster or in their constituencies, were being currently being monitored by the intelligence agencies. In the Commons, Bercow was pressed by several MPs including Alex Salmond, David Winnick, David Davis and Peter Bone to make the government clarify whether parliamentarians are currently being monitored by GCHQ. Chris Bryant, the shadow leader of the House, asked a minister to come to the Commons to give a statement on the Wilson doctrine, but Chris Grayling, the leader of the House, declined to get up from his seat to offer an explanation. Bryant said: \u201cThe freedom of members to be able to speak without fear or favour and without fear of being spied on by the government or any other agency is a vital part of us being able to do our jobs as representatives. It strikes at the heart of our liberties.\u201d Winnick, a Labour MP who was present at the time the Wilson doctrine was set out, said it would \u201cgrave disservice to parliament\u201d if it was abandoned , while Bone, a Conservative, said MPs had exhausted all avenues in trying to get an answer out of the government themselves. While sympathetic to the concerns, Bercow said it was not his place to pressure the government and suggested MPs submit an urgent question to ministers. Rosa Curling, a solicitor with the law firm Leigh Day, which represented Lucas and Jones, said: \u201cPromises made by successive prime ministers about the Wilson doctrine were not worth the paper they were written on. \u201cThe Wilson doctrine was put in place to reassure members of the public that their correspondence with their political representatives would be protected. This protection was, and continues to be, required so the public feel able to raise complaints about government policies and to expose wrongdoings of the government, without the government or its agencies snooping on these communications.\u201d Sara Ogilvie, policy officer for Liberty, said: \u201cOnce again, the woeful inadequacies of our surveillance laws are laid bare. The impending investigatory powers bill presents a once-in-a-generation chance for MPs to legislate for strong, transparent protections for their constituents\u2019 correspondence, and to end the undemocratic practice of suspicionless surveillance of us all.\u201d Matthew Rice, of Privacy International, said: \u201cToday\u2019s tribunal ruling that MPs should have no special protection from having their communications intercepted, confirms what Privacy International have been arguing for a long time: mass surveillance affects us all. \u201cAnyone who has exchanged emails with their MP about a sensitive matter should be aware that government snoopers may have access to this personal information. From charity workers to politicians, lawyers to refugees, it is of great concern that the UK\u2019s surveillance regime cannot function without interfering with everyone\u2019s right to privacy, regardless of their need for professional confidentiality.\u201d\n",

This is the sort of film that could make the most easygoing viewer feel twitchy, so imagine how it might inflame the paranoia of a blowhard like Trump; the whole picture only proves his assertion that \u201cthere are a lot of bad \u2018dudes\u2019 out there\u201d. Of course, Harry goes nuts by the end, and destroys his entire apartment in the search for bugging devices \u2013 although Trump may see this not as cautionary but as a metaphor for \u201cdraining the swamp\u201d. What\u2019s more, there is even a little inbuilt cheat in the plot: when we first hear the secretly recorded conversation on which the entire film hinges, it sounds one way (\u201cHe\u2019d kill us if he got the chance\u201d). Played back at the end, it has an entirely different emphasis (\u201cHe\u2019d kill us if he got the chance\u201d). Creative licence or fake news? Either way, it\u2019s an object lesson in the art of Trumpian spin, where \u201ctruth\u201d means whatever he happens to be saying at that particular moment. All the President\u2019s Men (1976)\nIn his tweets accusing the Obama administration of wiretapping his New York offices, Trump invoked the spectre of the US\u2019s greatest presidential scandal: \u201cThis is Nixon/Watergate,\u201d he fumed. So it seems reasonable to assume he has seen the movie that repackaged those events for cinema audiences. But he will have needed to be selective about which lessons he took from it. After all, this is a film about the brilliance and cunning of two men \u2013 Bob Woodward (Robert Redford) and Carl Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) \u2013 who belong to what Steve Bannon openly refers to as \u201cthe opposition party\u201d. Those Washington Post reporters broke the Watergate story with the help of the unnamed source they christened Deep Throat \u2013 and don\u2019t be surprised if those were the two words that made Trump\u2019s ears prick up. Though he may not have been paying quite as much attention to the scene where Woodward tells Bernstein: \u201cIf you\u2019re gonna do it, do it right. If you\u2019re gonna hype it, hype it with the facts.\u201d Sneakers (1992)\nRobert Redford again, this time in a lighter and fluffier surveillance story, but one that would be no less effective in confirming Trump\u2019s suspicions about those damn scheming, Clinton-loving liberals. Redford plays a security expert and former radical whose college days were spent diverting funds from Republican party coffers to assorted charitable causes. The plot pits him and his techno-buddies (including a blind phone-tapping genius) against an anarchist (Ben Kingsley) who is intent on destroying the system. The film shows Kingsley hacking into and outsmarting Trump\u2019s bete noire, the FBI, while it also paints the NSA (another organisation besmirched by Trump) in a sinister light, two decades before Edward Snowden blew the whistle on it. Still, he won\u2019t be happy with the ending, which shows Redford back to his old tricks and siphoning off Republican money to the United Negro College Fund, Amnesty International and Greenpeace. Enemy of the State (1998)\nIt will delight Trump no end that the NSA comes in for a bruising once again in this conspiracy thriller. From the opening scene, in which an NSA operative engineers the death of a congressman who is blocking a bill that would grant greater powers of surveillance over US citizens, phone-tapping plays a major part in the story. So concerned was the NSA by the way it was portrayed in the film that there were memos flying back and forth across its various departments. \u201cI saw a preview for the new movie Enemy of the State and to my surprise found out that NSA were the \u2018bad guys\u2019 in it,\u201d wrote one NSA employee in an in-house email, while the then director of the NSA, Lt Gen Michael Hayden, told CNN in 2001: \u201cI made the judgment that we couldn\u2019t survive with the popular impression of this agency being formed by the last Will Smith movie.\u201d As with The Conversation (which is referenced nicely in an appearance from Gene Hackman, playing Harry Caul in all but name), the impression given by the film is clear: you are being watched. Blow Out (1981)\nA mix of Blow Up (where a photographer accidentally captures evidence of a murder) and The Conversation, Brian De Palma\u2019s masterful thriller features a sound effects designer (John Travolta) who is taping ambient noise one evening when he records the sound of a car accident that turns out to provide clues to political skullduggery. Inspired by the Chappaquiddick scandal, in which Mary Jo Kopechne died in a car that was driven off a bridge by Senator Ted Kennedy, and still haunted by the ghost of Watergate, Blow Out would be helpful in reminding Trump that someone, somewhere, is always listening. Given that the meddling hero is part of the movie industry (ie Hollywood, another of Trump\u2019s enemies), the film also confirms some of his other prejudices into the bargain. The Bourne series (2002-present)\nThese films, about a brainwashed CIA killing machine who gradually recovers his memory and goes rogue, would appeal most strongly to Trump\u2019s particular combination of short attention span and heightened paranoia. The bonanza of conspiracy theories are regularly being interrupted by wham-bam action sequences that might have been designed specifically to keep him from getting bored. Trump, don\u2019t forget, is a man who fast-forwards through Jean-Claude Van Damme\u2019s Bloodsport just to get to the fisticuffs and roundhouse kicks. But should he be listening during the talky bits, he may find one exchange from the third instalment, The Bourne Ultimatum, particularly pertinent to his style of governance. The conscientious CIA agent Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) takes issue with the company policy of bumping people off willy-nilly. \u201cYou start down this path and where does it end?\u201d she asks her superior (David Strathairn), who gives the sort of response that Trump and his coterie could really get behind: \u201cIt ends when we\u2019ve won.\u201d\n",

Sir Mark Waller, the intelligence services commissioner, reveals in his annual report that GCHQ reported one error to him last year when it was found that an internal monitoring system, which keeps an eye on staff communications, was capturing an unauthorised amount of information. \u201cI followed up on this error during my May inspection, and the team explained that because of a lack of understanding of the systems\u2019 full capability more data than had been authorised had been collected,\u201d said Waller. \u201cIt was clear to me this was a technical error and not deliberate. Following the discovery of the error, GCHQ deleted the captured data and reconfigured the system to ensure that it only collected the information it was authorised to collect. I continue to monitor this project to ensure that this error does not happen again.\u201d The GCHQ episode is among 43 errors by the security agencies, reported in 2014 by the intelligence services commissioner, which led to intrusion of personal privacy to some degree. The commissioner revealed that, when he first started monitoring the misuse of data, there were two serious data breaches by individual security service contractors, each of whom had carried out \u201cunnecessary queries\u201d of bulk datasets (the mass of highly personal information held by the intelligence services on named individuals) without proper \u201cbusiness\u201d justification. Waller said: \u201cBoth were contractors, and in both cases, following investigation, they were escorted from the premises and their contract revoked.\u201d More recently, an MI6 officer was issued with a breach notice after he accessed the system containing the bulk personal datasets after moving to a job that did not require access. He was reprimanded, even though his access to the highly personal information was for a legitimate work purpose. The commissioner said that such unacceptable uses were few in number.\n",

I remember it was a Thursday because I wrote in my journal: \u201cThursday \u2013 idea for screenplay: artist/barista gets scouted to become MI5 spy\u201d. And it was raining \u2013 of course, typical me goes out in pure lemon suede. Livid. But when I got to the studio (we rent a space round the back of Haggerston; really good light in case we want to become painters) and had a smoke I thought: not screenplay, real life! I could totally do that. And here is why. As a creative, I\u2019m all about finding solutions to problems, whether how best to rebrand a misogynist coffee shop (hire a plus sized) or sort out Isis (first rule of branding: don\u2019t keep changing your name, you wallies!). I\u2019m all about making stuff funky \u2013 ie I\u2019m the guy who gave you street food van names Shit the Bread, Chew Baklava, Naan-y State and Gruel Intentions. Yeah, I have a fairly unique way of working. Like you lot, I don\u2019t believe in old-fashioned advertising. I respect that, man, the way you just jet cleaned your ad on the pavement along with all the discarded laughing gas canisters and Red Bull vomit, like: \u201cFirst spy test, look down!\u201d as if to say: \u201cWe\u2019re looking for authenticity here, dude \u2013 we want people who look between the cracks, who see adverts where others would just see Old Street, which is over.\u201d Jet cleaning a wanted ad on the kerb, scrubbing away society\u2019s filth to find the truth beneath. Love it. I\u2019m the same. I put little cards under people\u2019s moped wipers: just my Tumblr. If they get it, they get it. Also, I know you get a lot of crap for all the snooping, Snowden etc, but let me just be clear. I LIKE to be watched. And not in a kinky way, shut up. My dad calls it apathy; I call it security. Every time I look at my inbox and see Gmail has noticed I\u2019ve been Googling, say, my ex\u2019s band, Malcolm Gladwell Conspiracy, and targeted an Amazon ad at me, I feel like I\u2019m being\u2026 comforted. Patted on the shoulder, warmly. God knows my parents never properly hugged me, never told me they supported my decision to leave that idiot law conversion course, so when Gmail is curious about my life I see it as a happy stand-in. The internet is keeping an eye on me. Every data grab is the equivalent of being told I\u2019m interesting. Keep at it \u2013 damn the mans! Work experience: mate, I\u2019ve done it all. Coffee architect. Freelance war correspondent. Scent consultant. App archeologist. Successful poet. Radical knitwear designer. Voracious reader of difficult novels. Trainer customiser. Lover. Friend. Man. Because that\u2019s what you\u2019re really after, isn\u2019t it, G? Someone who is comfortable both in their skin and out of it, someone who can sit across a bar from a 6ft 4in Russian (as I often did in my summer working flair at the Royal Oak) and become, like a mirror for their thoughts so they\u2019ll tell you literally anything. One time a guy started drinking at three, and by eight he\u2019d tattooed his pin number on my wrist with a Biro and my hoop earring. 7674. Smiley face in the six. Show you when I see you, it\u2019s wicked. You\u2019re not wanting one of those suited Bond dicks (please, who \u201cshakes\u201d a martini in 2015?); you\u2019re after someone real. Someone who can blend into any university town with a decent vinyl shop and craft community, someone invisible in a crowd of nice hair. I\u2019m more your Ben Whishaw-type spy. I\u2019m very \u201ccould be on the door at Duckie\u201d. Totally fluid sexually. In theory. And may I just say, while I have you, that I appreciate your endorsement of my people. With your touting for business on the pavement outside the one remaining gay bar in this postcode, you get it. That, however much your eye gets drawn to the beard, or the cereal, ours is a culture based on good things, like art and protest, and not being our parents. But where was I? Oh yeah, crowds. Don\u2019t like them. Someone nicked my phone at Latitude during Kwabs, texted my mum a picture of their balls. But I hear there\u2019s a good deli bar at your Cheltenham headquarters.

        "body": "The British surveillance agency GCHQ has hinted that cryptography enthusiasts determined to complete its complex Christmas puzzle before Sunday\u2019s deadline should work in groups to make it through the five stages of the test. The authors of the fiendish test, which has so far not been completed by anyone, also said entrants were getting too excited about the rumoured prize; the winner would receive \u201ca signed book and some token GCHQ keepsake \u2013 maybe a paperweight\u201d. The puzzle was released to the public in the GCHQ Christmas card and later posted on the agency\u2019s website. It has prompted weeks of frustration among the tens of thousands of people who have made it to the final round. Some 30,000 players \u2013 about 5% of those who entered the first level \u2013 had reached the final stage of the puzzle, which was created by a small team of GCHQ cryptographers. A number of people were \u201cvery close\u201d to completing the final puzzle, according to a spokesman for GCHQ, but no answer received so far had been 100% correct.\nParticipants must have logic, numeracy, literacy and reasoning skills to make it through the different stages. The spokesman confirmed the puzzle was similar to tests used in past GCHQ recruitment campaigns, and said the team who created the puzzle were \u201cincredibly impressed\u201d by how far some players had got. \u201cIt is remarkable how the general public have helped each other \u2013 through various groups and online forums \u2013 and it\u2019s very encouraging that so many of the general public have got so far though it.\u201d Nearly 600,000 people have attempted to complete the puzzle since its release in early December. Those determined to complete the final stage have until 11.59pm on 31 January to finish. Gareth Moore, secretary of the UK Puzzle Association, said players should approach the puzzle in groups given the diversity of skills needed to make it through the stages. \u201cThese are puzzles that would be best solved in groups of people with complementary skills,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that any one individual would have all the necessary skills and knowledge and insight on their own.\u201d People attempting the puzzles not only need excellent maths skills but must have a broad knowledge of the English language as well as some French. \u201cYou\u2019re basically describing all the skills you\u2019d get from a range of people who work with GCHQ.\u201d Nigel Smart, professor of cryptography at the University of Bristol, said people needed to \u201cthink like an adversary\u201d to figure out complex cryptology. \u201cYou have to think with deviousness,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople who are setting you a puzzle are trying to catch you out. It\u2019s like an Agatha Christie novel, you\u2019re trying to guess the solution to the puzzle before the big reveal.\u201d Smart said the GCHQ puzzle was a way to raise the profile of the agency\u2019s cybersecurity work while trying to recruit new cryptological minds. \u201cIt\u2019s very similar to how in the second world war Bletchley Park put puzzles in the Times to recruit people. It\u2019s a more traditional way to get people interested in cryptology. It\u2019s also to raise the GCHQ profile and make people think, \u2018I could possibly work like this.\u2019\u201d The GCHQ director, Robert Hannigan, said he was delighted so many people had tried to complete the puzzle and said his one clue was \u201cit\u2019s not as abstract as you think\u201d. \u201cWhat I hope the stages of the puzzle show is that to deliver our mission and keep Britain safe we need people from all backgrounds, with all skills, who look at problems from every angle,\u201d he said in a statement. The agency will publish the complete solution to all stages of the puzzle on its website in early February after all entries have been received. The agency has invited those taking part to make a donation to the children\u2019s charity NSPCC.\n",

        "body": "David Cameron\u2019s response to the Paris attacks was swift. At the G20 summit in Turkey he previewed the forthcoming defence and security review, which will promise to recruit 1,900 more intelligence officers for MI5, MI6 and GCHQ. Easier said than done, however. Because these days hiring spies is maybe the hardest part of spying. Indeed at GCHQ, which monitors enemy communications and protects British data, the recruitment drive was already underway. Since last Monday the streets of Britain have been sprayed with a cryptic message: \u201cGCH-Who? Technical Opportunities gchq-careers.co.uk\u201d. The words appeared on pavements in Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, Wolverhampton and Shoreditch \u2013 not sprayed in paint, but washed out of the street\u2019s own grime with a stencil and a pressure hose. The choice of Shoreditch was especially interesting. This part of east London, in the unlikely event that you hadn\u2019t heard, is home to Silicon Roundabout, the country\u2019s biggest cluster of of tech startups. It also is (or was) the epicentre of UK hipsterism, and it shows what the intelligence agencies are up against \u2013 not just bad guys, but cooler employers.\nSpies have to be clever, remember. Very clever. A great deal of them need to be highly trained in computing or mathematics. As GCHQ\u2019s own website says, \u201cOur technical specialists work with \u2013 and often develop \u2013 unique, highly advanced technologies. Our analysts piece together complex data and produce insightful reports.\u201d Finding such skilled staff is a problem in many industries, but for GCHQ it is a nightmare. They do their work in secret, for one thing, so people hear very little about it. Nor can they recruit abroad, as a school or a hospital might, because even a nice foreigner rather undermines the idea of \u201cnational\u201d security. The problem has a further layer of irony because \u2013 to simplify for a moment \u2013 GCHQ actually invented computers. The Colossus machines that Alan Turing and Tommy Flowers built at Bletchley Park during the war have turned into an industry that absorbs the people who might be Turing\u2019s and Flowers\u2019s successors. There\u2019s some glamour in being a spy, admittedly, but you can\u2019t show off about it. It\u2019s a steady job on decent pay, but it won\u2019t make you the next Zuckerberg. You also have to work in Cheltenham, probably, or perhaps Bude, Harrogate or Scarborough \u2013 nice places, to be sure, but perhaps still too \u201cundiscovered\u201d even for hipsters. Doing good is probably the main appeal of spying, but then not everybody wants to feel that their day at the office might one day fail to stop a terrorist attack.\nPressure wash stencilling is far from a new advertising tool these days. Indeed, someone else is doing it in Shoreditch, too, to promote \u201c12 Weeks of Techno\u201d. It seems a bit of a stretch for GCHQ to be talking like a night club \u2013 the ads were reportedly the idea of its recruitment agency, Penna \u2013 but they clearly feel the need to put some excitement into the idea of government surveillance. In the past, they\u2019ve published special puzzles that only those with the right skills could decode. And there is at least something apt this time about spies advertising with a message that eventually self-destructs. GCHQ\u2019s official line is that they are \u201calways looking to widen our recruitment focus to reach the people we would like to recruit and therefore we use a range of innovative channels for our advertising.\u201d They won\u2019t talk to me about why they\u2019re after hipsters, though. They won\u2019t even talk about why they won\u2019t talk. \u201cThey look pretty cool,\u201d says Alex, looking at the ads. She is 32, dressed in a smart grey coat and smoking a cigarette. She works with computers at a local interior design firm. Would she consider working for GCHQ then? \u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t.\u201d Why not? \u201cFirstly I haven\u2019t heard of them. And at the moment, because I love interior design and architecture I would stay where I am.\u201d It is, we agree, a big leap from interior design to counter-terrorism. \u201cI suppose it would be quite interesting though, a bit of spy work. I\u2019m a big fan of James Bond so, maybe.\u201d One other thing: the main office is in Cheltenham. \u201cOh for God\u2019s sake! I live in Angel. No, I\u2019m not going to bugger off to Cheltenham. Sorry.\u201d How about Harrogate? Scarborough? Bude? \u201cI like Angel. Angel\u2019s very glitzy and great and fantastic.\u201d\nThe next person I speak to is Jake, 35, who other than being clean-shaven looks in his blue suit every inch the dapper hipster gent. He\u2019s noticed the ads too. Does he have any technical skills that might transfer to spying? \u201cGod no. I\u2019m an actor.\u201d More enthusiastic is Paul, also 35. He works in an ad agency but sounds like he would jump at the chance to join GCHQ instead. \u201cI think it would be quite interesting, a bit more than a normal nine-to-five job,\u201d he says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have thought I\u2019d be suitably qualified, though.\u201d Finally Nick comes along. He\u2019s 28, a programmer, dressed well but not showily, bang in the centre of the target audience. He doesn\u2019t know what the ads are about, and when I tell him, he isn\u2019t grabbed immediately. \u201cI prefer more creative than destructive things,\u201d he says. \u201cI know that to protect against [cyber-terrorism] you need to be a hacker to start with, maybe, then go white-hat as opposed to black-hat. My skill set isn\u2019t good enough for that. I don\u2019t really know what it takes to be an anti-hacker. I think I would need some training. I would probably [understand], because I love that kind of thing. I love security, and we do quite a lot in my company.\u201d\nIt sounds like he is talking himself around. So would he consider it? \u201cThere\u2019s no reason that I wouldn\u2019t. Every time I watch MI5 or James Bond I always think it\u2019s a glamorous thing to do, but I don\u2019t ever consider it as a job. It\u2019s more like a movie thing. I think I would definitely consider it if I met someone who did it. Or maybe if there was someone public who was outspoken about it, who was in my role, and it wasn\u2019t all secretive and hidden.\u201d Finally, the killer question. Would he move to one of the GCHQ locations? \u201cEventually I will move out, and those places sound lovely \u2026 Right now, I love London though.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook and join the discussion\n",

        "body": "The former legal manager at the News of the World, who ordered the surveillance of two solicitors engaged in litigation against the newspaper for phone hacking, has been cleared of professional misconduct after a disciplinary tribunal unanimously rejected all charges against him. Tom Crone, who was responsible for the tabloid\u2019s legal affairs at the height of the phone-hacking scandal, was accused of six charges of attempting to uncover an alleged affair between the solicitors to provide the paper with \u201cgood leverage\u201d in legal proceedings. If proved, he could have been disbarred. After the disciplinary tribunal rejected all charges, Crone, who represented himself in the hearing, said: \u201cI\u2019m very relieved. \u201cThe way the evidence was presented against me \u2013 a very serious allegation of criminal conduct \u2013 was wholly unfair and utterly unwarranted by the evidence, which thankfully the tribunal acknowledges.\u201d The case brought by the Bar Standards Board was that Crone\u2019s purpose in organising surveillance of Mark Lewis and Charlotte Harris in 2010 was to smear, embarrass and threaten them in order to gain an unfair advantage in legal proceedings. The surveillance found no evidence of any affair. On Monday, the judge, John Price, said that the five-person panel of the Bar Tribunals and Adjudication Service had been unanimous in their rejection of all charges against Crone. One of the key issues the panel considered in a tribunal where the standard of proof is the criminal standard of \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d was Crone\u2019s intention in ordering surveillance of the lawyers. Price said: \u201cOur unanimous conclusion on counts one to four is we are not sure that Mr Crone\u2019s intention was to force Lewis and Harris to withdraw their claim or to settle more favourably.\u201d With regard to counts five and six, relating to the surveillance of the former wife and teenage daughter of Lewis, the question was whether by ordering the surveillance of Lewis, Crone had caused the surveillance of his family. Price said the panel was sure Crone had not authorised or caused the surveillance of Lewis\u2019s family. On that basis, the judge said: \u201cWe reject charges five and six as well.\u201d In earlier panel hearings, Crone admitted requesting that the solicitors Lewis and Harris, then both at the Manchester firm George Davies, which is now part of Mills and Reeve, be placed under surveillance in order to uncover an alleged affair, but he denied the charge that his purpose in doing so was to pressurise them to withdraw or settle advantageously. Crone told the panel that if Lewis and Harris were having an affair it would have provided circumstantial evidence that they were passing confidential information between between each other. The intention, he said, was to gather evidence to report them to the Solicitors Regulation Authority, alleging they had breached professional standards. Crone, who no longer practises law, joined Rupert Murdoch\u2019s UK newspaper division in 1985 acting for both NoW and the Sun. He resigned in July 2011, the month in which the NoW closed. He was arrested in August 2012 in connection with the Metropolitan police\u2019s investigation into hacking but in October 2014 the Crown Prosecution Service announced he would not face charges.\n",

        "body": "A News of the World lawyer ordered surveillance of two solicitors engaged in litigation against the paper for phone hacking in order to gain an improper advantage, a disciplinary tribunal has heard. Tom Crone, legal affairs manager with the now defunct newspaper\u2019s publisher, News International (now News UK), is accused of attempting to uncover an alleged affair between the two colleagues to provide the NoW with \u201cgood leverage\u201d in legal proceedings. The Bar Standards Board has brought six charges of professional misconduct against him, which, if proved, could lead to him being disbarred. He denies the charges. At Tuesday\u2019s hearing of the tribunal in central London, prosecuting counsel Christopher Aylwin, told the five-person panel that Crone asked the paper\u2019s newsdesk to put solicitors Mark Lewis and Charlotte Harris under surveillance in order to find out information that could embarrass the pair. \u201cIt was your intention to use evidence of the affair, if you\u2019d got it, to persuade \u2013 and I use the word neutrally \u2013 to pressure Miss Harris and Mr Lewis,\u201d said Aylwin, cross-examining Crone. \u201cYou were looking for an excuse to embarrass them in their private lives. You would not have used a bare-faced threat \u2013 you\u2019re far too aware of the consequences to have done that \u2013 but there are ways of getting your point across, are there not?\u201d Crone admits requesting that the solicitors, then both at Manchester firm George Davies (now part of Mills and Reeve), be placed under surveillance but denies the charge that it was aimed at getting advantage by improper means. The surveillance found no evidence of an affair. Crone claims that he acted because of concerns that the pair were leaking confidential legal information to the Guardian and exchanging confidential information relating to different phone-hacking claims they were working on when they should not have been. Among the cases Lewis worked on was the claim by then Professional Football Association boss Gordon Taylor, which was cited in the initial Guardian revelations about the phone-hacking scandal. Crone told the panel that if Lewis and Harris were having an affair it would have provided circumstantial evidence that they were passing confidential information between each other. The intention would then be to report them to the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA), alleging that they had breached professional standards, he said. But Aylwin said Crone\u2019s intention was \u201cto obtain good leverage. It wasn\u2019t anything to do with recusal or claims to the SRA, it was to have your way as far as the litigation was concerned.\u201d Crone, who often expressed irritation at the questioning, replied: \u201cNo, that was absolutely not the case.\u201d He added: \u201cI would regard that as a clear blackmail threat which I wouldn\u2019t make. I wouldn\u2019t dream of doing that.\u201d He said that any such threat would have been futile against experienced solicitors such as Lewis and Harris, who would have simply rung the police. Crone joined Rupert Murdoch\u2019s UK newspaper division in 1985, acting for both the NoW and the Sun. He resigned in July 2011, the month in which the NoW was closed. In 2007, after the jailing of the NoW\u2019s royal editor, Clive Goodman, he supervised an internal investigation into hacking at the paper but could find no evidence to suggest anyone else was involved. Crone gave evidence to the Commons culture, media and sport select committee about hacking allegations and also to the Leveson inquiry. He was arrested in August 2012 in connection with the Metropolitan police\u2019s investigation into hacking but in October 2014, the Crown Prosecution Service announced he would not face charges because there was \u201cinsufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction\u201d. Among those watching proceedings was Formula one boss Max Mosley who, in 2008, when Crone was still at News International, won \u00a360,000 in a privacy action against NoW after the Sunday tabloid falsely accused him of taking part in a \u201csick Nazi orgy\u201d. The hearing was adjourned until later this month.\n",

        "body": "The legality of Britain\u2019s surveillance laws will come under the intense scrutiny of 15 European judges on Tuesday in a politically sensitive test case that could limit powers to gather online data. The outcome of the hearing at the European court of justice (ECJ) in Luxembourg is likely to influence the final shape of the government\u2019s investigatory powers bill and will test judicial relationships within the EU. Around a dozen EU states including the UK have intervened in the challenge against the government\u2019s Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014 (Dripa) that was originally brought by two MPs, the Conservative David Davis and Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson. The British case is being heard in conjunction with a Swedish case based on similar principles. ECJ rulings are binding on British courts and its decision could have a decisive impact on the powers of GCHQ, the Cheltenham-based monitoring agency. The case may have further significance as it is being heard in the run-up to the UK\u2019s EU referendum on 23 June. The high court in London has already ruled that the powers in Dripa are inconsistent with European Union law, and as a result those powers are due to expire at the end of this year. The court of appeal is asking the ECJ to clarify the impact of an earlier ruling, known as Digital Rights Ireland, which limits the collection of data. Davis, an arch-Eurosceptic, therefore finds himself in the curious position of asking EU judges to overturn Westminster legislation. He is expected to find time to attend the ECJ hearing on Tuesday. The court\u2019s final decision is expected to be delivered after the referendum but it is possible that the Danish advocate-general in the case could deliver his preliminary opinion before 23 June. The case is likely to set clearer guidance on the legality of bulk interception of emails and online data by intelligence agencies. A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe are clear that the UK regime for communications data retention and acquisition contains very stringent safeguards to protect privacy and data. We hope that the ECJ will recognise that any omissions in the original EU directive are unrelated to the UK regime.\u201d Once the ECJ has given its opinion, the court of appeal in London will then have to apply that decision to UK surveillance legislation. Davis and Watson are being represented by lawyers for the civil rights group Liberty. Silkie Carlo, policy officer for Liberty, said: \u201cThe ECJ\u2019s findings could have profound ramifications for the investigatory powers bill. If judges find Dripa\u2019s scheme of bulk retention and self-authorised access breaches human rights law, huge swaths of this fatally flawed bill will be called into question. \u201cThe intrusive bulk powers challenged in this case pale in comparison to those now sought by the government \u2013 which include bulk hacking, the acquisition of vast databases containing sensitive information on millions of innocent people and powers to force communications companies to keep our entire web browsing histories.\u201d James Welch, Liberty\u2019s legal director, said: \u201cLiberty strongly supports the use of surveillance in fighting crime, but only if it\u2019s targeted. The government\u2019s approach of sweeping up and storing everybody\u2019s data with no effective safeguards is excessive. \u201cThis case could stop the fatally flawed investigatory powers bill in its tracks and mark a sea change in the fight for an effective, targeted system of surveillance that keeps us safe and protects our rights.\u201d Dripa allows the home secretary to force communications companies to preserve communications data for 12 months, catching the data records of everybody in the UK including confidential or privileged correspondence of MPs, journalists, lawyers and doctors. It is subject to safeguards whose effects are in dispute. Both Privacy International and Open Rights Group are also intervening in the case. Camilla Graham Wood, legal officer at Privacy International, said: \u201cThe UK, in enacting legislation that is almost identical to the European data retention directive which the [ECJ] ruled unlawful, is mandating data retention on a widespread, indiscriminate and untargeted basis. \u201cSuch a broad and wholesale retention of communications data is in violation of European law. The effect of Dripa is to use bulk data retention to create a dossier on every person in the UK. It includes every internet and mobile phone transaction you undertake, every location will be filed, every meeting noted, every website indexed and every call marked. \u201cBlanket retention of communications data, without suspicion, creates a honeypot of information for criminals and hackers, and this case will have implications for personal privacy and the security of individual personal data.\u201d Open Rights Group\u2019s legal director, Myles Jackman, said: \u201cThe court found that you shouldn\u2019t collect people\u2019s data unless there is a specific reason and that there should be strict controls for allowing access to this data. With both Dripa and the IP bill, the British government has ignored this call to respect our human rights. \u201cWe look forward to the [ECJ]\u2019s clarification of their ruling and hope that it condemns once and for all the blanket collection of our personal data.\u201d\n",

        "body": "The extraordinary public rebuke by the United States\u2019 closest surveillance partner has revealed an emerging characteristic of Donald Trump\u2019s White House: a willingness to antagonize even its allies instead of admitting error. GCHQ, the UK surveillance mammoth intimately linked to the National Security Agency (NSA), has taken public exception to an allegation repeated from the White House podium that, if true, would probably shatter the Five Eyes intelligence alliance so dear to both Washington and London. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, credulously repeated on Thursday an account by a Fox News pundit, Andrew Napolitano, that GCHQ laundered surveillance on Trump at the behest of Barack Obama. Napolitano, who is in no position to actually know, made the allegation apparently to explain away the emerging consensus, even from senior Republicans on the intelligence committees, that there is no basis to Trump\u2019s claim that Obama ordered that surveillance. GCHQ practically never responds to stories about its operations. But the implications of this one are severe. There would be no way for the NSA and GCHQ, which are joined at the hip, to continue their partnership if GCHQ was willing to interfere in the US political process. On Friday, 10 Downing Street said it had received assurances from the White House that it will not repeat the allegation, which suggests that the White House did not realize the implications of what it said. The context matters here. Spicer repeated Napolitano\u2019s allegation for the same reason Napolitano made it: to defend Trump\u2019s evidence-free assertion, on 4 March, that Obama had Trump\u2019s team placed under surveillance. Spicer did so while reading off a long list of news reports, both credible and not, about aspects of surveillance intercepts related to Trump and Russia. Spicer\u2019s implication is that if Trump was wrong \u2013 which he did not concede \u2013 it was because the journalists calling attention to Trump\u2019s error lack credibility. Not a single credible news account Spicer read supports Trump\u2019s 4 March claim. Napolitano\u2019s did. The context of Trump\u2019s 4 March claim matters as well. Trump accused Obama of felonious surveillance \u2013 presidents cannot legally order their political opponents spied upon \u2013 to discredit evidence that Russia sought to aid his election. That evidence of Russian interference, and the fallout from it, has been endorsed by three US intelligence agencies. It prompted Trump\u2019s national security adviser to resign. It made his chief of staff, Reince Priebus, inquire about enlisting the FBI to refute news reports. It caused his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, to recuse himself from official inquiries. And the point of Trump\u2019s claim, unequivocally denied by Obama, is to say all of this is smoke conjured by Trump\u2019s political opponents. One option always available to the White House is to forthrightly concede Trump was wrong. It has shown no appetite for that. Instead, Trump and his allies have grasped for whatever explanation might keep alive an incendiary accusation \u2013 one that is itself an unforced error \u2013 without regard for the relationships those explanations damage. Even now, with GCHQ and 10 Downing Street angry, the White House is stopping short of an apology. \u201cAmbassador Kim Darroch and Sir Mark Lyall expressed their concerns to Sean Spicer and General McMaster. Mr Spicer and General McMaster explained that Mr Spicer was simply pointing to public reports, not endorsing any specific story,\u201d according to the current White House line. The White House has been here before. Mexico\u2019s president cancelled a state visit after Trump kept claiming Mexico would pay for a border wall. Trump invented an attack in Sweden in order to bolster his dubious claim that refugees are incipient terrorists. He antagonized another Five Eyes ally, Australia, over refugee policy as well. Trump, like all recent presidents, will soon confront a major domestic or international crisis. It may be a mass shooting, a terrorist attack, a natural disaster, a foreign threat, a military debacle. At that point, the US and the world will, as it does, look to the White House for a truthful account of what has happened, both to understand the US assessment of the danger and for reassurance. Yet Trump\u2019s behavior has drained away the very credibility he attempts to preserve.\n",

        "body": "EU judges in Luxembourg could limit key powers in UK surveillance laws just weeks before Britain votes on its EU membership. An emergency hearing on the bulk interception of communications data has been scheduled for 12 April at the European court of justice (ECJ), whose rulings are binding on UK courts. Its final decision could have a decisive impact on the powers of GCHQ, the Cheltenham-based monitoring agency, and could come shortly before Britons decide whether to remain in or leave the EU on 23 June. At issue is the effect of an influential earlier ECJ ruling, Digital Rights Ireland, which has already been used to overturn the government\u2019s Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014 (Dripa) on the grounds that it is \u201cinconsistent with European Union law\u201d. The challenge has been brought by two MPs, the Conservative David Davis and Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson. Davis is expected to attend the Luxembourg hearing. The case will focus on the legality of how police and intelligence services access retained data, judicial authorisation of the process and bulk interception of information relating to emails, phone calls and text messages.\nThe case raises such significant dilemmas in balancing conflicting interests of online privacy and national security that at least nine other EU countries and the European commission have also made submissions. Those issues are all crucial aspects of the investigatory powers bill, also known as the snooper\u2019s charter, which has had its second reading in parliament and will lay down the rules for future government surveillance. Clarification of EU law was sought by the court of appeal. In granting the expedited hearing, the president of the ECJ, the Belgian judge Koen Lenaerts, said the dispute was over Home Office powers \u201cto require public telecommunications operators to retain communications data for a maximum period of 12 months, retention of the content of the communications concerned being excluded\u201d. The judge also noted: \u201cIt is clear that national legislation that permits the retention of all electronic communications data and subsequent access to that data is liable to cause serious interference with the fundamental rights laid down in articles 7 and 8 of the charter of fundamental rights of the European Union.\u201d The role of the ECJ, the EU\u2019s highest court, has become more controversial as the referendum campaign is about to get under way. Whereas judgments from the European court of human rights in Strasbourg have only to be taken into account, those from the ECJ effectively have the force of law in UK courts. For years ECJ cases dealt almost exclusively with commercial matters, but the court\u2019s reach has expanded recently to include privacy, prisoners\u2019 rights and whether women can wear headscarves at work. In an attempt to limit the power of EU judges, the government \u2013 initially spurred on by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove \u2013 is preparing a sovereignty bill which is said to transform the UK\u2019s supreme court into a constitutional court capable of resisting undesirable rulings from EU judges. The legal principle is largely untested. A case called Gauweiler, about European Central Bank monetary policy, which involves the German constitutional court may yet provide a legal check on EU judges. Asked whether a UK sovereignty bill would be launched during the referendum campaign, a spokesperson for the Cabinet Office, which is overseeing the review, said: \u201cThere will be details in due course.\u201d There is a chance the ECJ judges hearing the case, one of whom is likely to be British, may not deliver their verdict before the referendum, although court documents acknowledge the need for an urgent reply.\nA number of organisations \u2013 including Privacy International, the Law Society and Open Rights Group \u2013 have also intervened in the ECJ case. Millie Graham Wood, from Privacy International, said: \u201c[We believe] that existing EU law rules out data retention regimes of the kind contained in Dripa and reflected in the investigatory powers bill. \u201cBlanket retention of communications data without suspicion violates the right to privacy, as well as putting the security of personal data at risk of attack by criminals and others.\u201d Daniel Carey, a solicitor who will represent Privacy International at the Luxembourg hearing, said: \u201cThis will be an important hearing for everyone\u2019s data protection rights. [Dripa] creates a privatised database of everyone\u2019s communications activity, and the investigatory powers bill only extends these powers further. \u201cThe regime of judicial authorisation in that bill has no application to data retention orders and applies only to local authorities when accessing retained data. We are asking the [ECJ] to make clear that powers of data retention and access must be confined to what is necessary and proportionate, and that these are not platitudes but legal principles that prohibit the broad powers the government seeks.\u201d\n",

        "body": "Labour has written to Theresa May, the home secretary, setting out seven areas of concern about the government\u2019s new laws handing more surveillance powers to the police, security services and other public bodies. Andy Burnham, the shadow home secretary, said if the party\u2019s objections to the new investigatory powers bill were not resolved, Labour would withdraw its support. Labour\u2019s letter comes after the legislation passed its first stage in the House of Commons last month; Labour and the SNP abstained in the vote, while the Liberal Democrats voted against. As more detailed parliamentary scrutiny of the bill gets under way, Burnham warned May: \u201cI hope you will accept that the seven points I have outlined are legitimate concerns and that you will work with us to address them properly.\n\u201cIf I determine that our concerns are not satisfactorily dealt with during the passage of the bill, then we will be unable to support a timetable that puts the bill on the statute book by December this year. \u201cI hope that is not necessary and that we can together produce a bill that commands a high degree of confidence and trust.\u201d The bill would give authorities access to internet connection records showing the website domains that people have visited. It will also tighten controls on interception of content, with judges required to give approval to warrants signed by ministers. Top of Labour\u2019s list of demands is a request for an amendment stating there should be a presumption in favour of privacy. Burnham also wants a higher threshold for authorities to be able to access the records, arguing it should only happen when serious crimes are suspected and that a smaller range of public bodies should be allowed to make use of the powers. The shadow home secretary said there should be additional protections for sensitive professions such as lawyers, MPs and journalists communicating with clients, constituents or sources. In a debate for the second reading of the bill last month, some Tories echoed Labour worries.\nKen Clarke, the Conservative former home secretary, and Dominic Grieve, the Tory former attorney general, suggested there could be improvements to the new laws that overhaul the state\u2019s surveillance powers. The government argues the bill is necessary to address a gap in the surveillance capabilities of law enforcement agencies because of technological advances. Previous attempts to close the gap with the communications data bill were dubbed the snooper\u2019s charter in the last parliament and blocked by the Lib Dems. Ministers could bow to some of Labour\u2019s demands due to a desire to get the legislation through parliament before emergency surveillance laws expire at the end of this year.\n",

More than 10 years after Twitter began, GCHQ dipped its public toe into the social networking water with the words \u201chello, world\u201d just after 11am on Monday.\nWithin half an hour of its verified feed, the GCHQ account attracted more than 2,000 followers. GCHQ is late to the official social media party by the standards of international security services. Its US equivalent, the National Security Agency, has been running an account since December 2013. The Central Intelligence Agency launched its account almost two years ago with a memorable first message.\nThe move is part of an effort to make the secretive Cheltenham listening post slightly more transparent and improve its public image after Edward Snowden revealed the industrial scale of mass surveillance by it and the NSA. The account launch is reported to have come after months of discussion. While ministers and diplomats have been encouraged to tweet for years, the security establishment has been reluctant to follow suit. Neither MI6 nor MI5 has an official Twitter account. But GCHQ\u2019s director, Robert Hannigan, has a brief to restore public trust in the agency. Andrew Pike, the director of communications at GCHQ, said: \u201cIn joining social media, GCHQ can use its own voice to talk directly about the important work we do in keeping Britain safe.\u201d The initial reaction to the account was of mockery, including from the former deputy prime minister John Prescott.\nDuncan Weldon, the head of research at the Resolution Foundation, wondered how users would react if GCHQ started following them on Twitter.\nThe former Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, who broke the story of Snowden\u2019s revelations, noted the irony of GCHQ\u2019s attempt to win public trust after previously trying to suppress news of its existence.\nIn a statement, GCHQ acknowledged that it had been a late adopter of Twitter. \u201cWe know that some will say we\u2019re joining the Twitter party slightly late, but we\u2019re the first intelligence agency in the UK to do this and it\u2019s a big step for the organisation as we become more open about the work we do to keep Britain safe,\u201d it said.\n\u201cSome things have to stay secret, sorry, so we won\u2019t be providing intelligence updates or giving away tradecraft. \u201cWe want GCHQ to be more accessible and to help the public understand more about our work. We also want to reach out to the technical community and add our voice to social media conversations about technology, maths, cybersecurity and other topics where we have a view.\u201d It explained that \u201chello, world\u201d was one of the first phrases that students of computer coding learn to write. \u201cAs a technical organisation with computing at its core, it resonated with many of our staff, who have learnt to program during their career,\u201d GCHQ said. \u2022 This article was amended on 16 May 2016 to remove the statement that blocking GCHQ on Twitter would make it more difficult for the organisation to legally spy on a user.\n",

        "body": "GCHQ\u2019s covert surveillance of two international human rights groups was illegal, the judicial tribunal responsible for handling complaints against the intelligence services has ruled. The UK government monitoring agency retained emails for longer than it should have and violated its own internal procedures, according to a judgment by the investigatory powers tribunal (IPT). But it ruled that the initial interception was lawful in both cases. The IPT upheld complaints by the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights and the South African non-profit Legal Resources Centre that their communications had been illegally retained and examined. The tribunal made \u201cno determination\u201d on claims brought other NGOs \u2013 including Amnesty International, Liberty and Privacy International \u2013 implying that either their emails and phone calls were not intercepted or that they were intercepted but by legal means. The IPT ruling said: \u201c[We are] concerned that steps should be taken to ensure that neither of the breaches of procedure referred to in this determination occurs again. For the avoidance of doubt, the tribunal makes it clear that it will be making a closed report to the prime minister.\u201d It is the first time that a court has revealed that British intelligence agencies have spied on foreign human rights groups.\nThe case against the monitoring agency follows revelations by the US whistleblower Edward Snowden. It was brought by Privacy International, Liberty, Amnesty International, the American Civil Liberties Union and a number of other international human rights groups. Welcoming the ruling, Eric King, deputy director of Privacy International, said: \u201cIf spying on human rights NGOs isn\u2019t off limits for GCHQ, then what is? Clearly our spy agencies have lost their way. For too long they\u2019ve been trusted with too much power, and too few rules for them to protect against abuse. How many more problems with GCHQ\u2019s secret procedures have to be revealed for them to be brought under control?\u201d He added: \u201cTrying to pass off such failings as technical, or significant changes in law as mere clarifications, has become a tiring defence for those who know the jig is up. The courts are begrudgingly helping to ensure that the sun is slowly setting on GCHQ\u2019s wild west ways. Now we need parliament to step in to fix what should have been fixed a long time ago.\u201d In relation to the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, the IPT found that \u201cemail communications ... were lawfully and proportionately intercepted and accessed ... However, the time limit for retention permitted under the internal policies of GCHQ, the intercepting agency, was overlooked in regard to the product of that interception, such that it was retained for materially longer than permitted under those policies.\u201d In respect of the Legal Resources Centre, the IPT said: \u201cCommunications from an [associated] email address ... were intercepted and selected for examination ... The tribunal is satisfied that the interception was lawful and proportionate and that the selection for examination was proportionate, but that the procedure laid down by GCHQ\u2019s internal policies for selection of the communications for examination was in error not followed in this case.\u201d Janet Love, national director of the Legal Resources Centre, said it was \u201cdeeply concerned to learn that communications of our organisation have been subject to unlawful interception by GCHQ. As a public interest law firm, our communications are self-evidently confidential, and we consider this to be a serious breach of the rights of our organisation and the individuals concerned. \u201cWe can no longer accept the conduct of the intelligence services acting under such a pernicious veil of secrecy, and we will be taking immediate action to try to establish more information. We urge the South African and British governments to cooperate with us in this regard. We are particularly grateful for Liberty\u2019s efforts in spearheading this litigation and making it possible for this information to be brought to light.\u201d James Welch, legal director for Liberty, said: \u201cLast year it was revealed that GCHQ were eavesdropping on sacrosanct lawyer-client conversations. Now we learn they\u2019ve been spying on human rights groups. What kind of signal are British authorities sending to despotic regimes and those who risk their lives to challenge them all over the world? Who is being casual with human life now?\u201d Rachel Logan, UK legal programme director for Amnesty International, said: \u201c[This] raises the wider question as to why the UK intelligence services were intercepting the communications of these two highly regarded human rights NGOs at all. \u201cKnowing that your mail has been read, or your calls have been listened to can stifle people into silence, leading to self-censorship. It is a clear interference with basic rights such as free expression and right to privacy. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling in relation to Amnesty tells us nothing. We still don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve been spied on at all, if we have been the subject of any targeted spying, if the tribunal thought any spying \u2013 if it did happen \u2013 was necessary and proportionate, or even if they had an entirely different reason for telling us nothing.\u201d The legal challenge was the first of many GCHQ-related claims to be examined in detail by the IPT, which hears complaints against British intelligence agencies and government bodies that carry out surveillance under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa). The civil liberties organisations are concerned that their private communications may have been monitored under GCHQ\u2019s electronic surveillance programme, Tempora, the existence of which was revealed by Snowden. They also complain that information obtained through the US National Security Agency\u2019s Prism and Upstream programmes may have been shared with British intelligence services, sidestepping protections provided by the UK legal system. During the hearing last summer, Matthew Ryder QC alleged that the intelligence services are constructing \u201cvast databases\u201d out of accumulated interceptions of emails. \u201cIf two out of 10 organisations who applied to the IPT found their emails were being illegally monitored, human rights fear, how many others are being targeted? Unless people or organisations submit claims to the IPT, it is argued, how will they know whether their communications are being unlawfully monitored.\u201d A government spokesperson said: \u201cWe welcome the IPT\u2019s confirmation that any interception by GCHQ in these cases was undertaken lawfully and proportionately, and that where breaches of policies occurred they were not sufficiently serious to warrant any compensation to be paid to the bodies involved. \u201cGCHQ takes procedure very seriously. It is working to rectify the technical errors identified by this case and constantly reviews its processes to identify and make improvements.\u201d\n",

The court in Strasbourg has told the government to provide submissions by the beginning of May about whether GCHQ's spying activities could be a violation of the right to privacy under article 8 of the European convention. Marking the case a priority, campaigners are hopeful the court will bring a ruling before the end of the year. The case was brought last September by Big Brother Watch, the Open Rights Group and English PEN, along with the German internet activist Constanze Kurz. It followed the Guardian's revelations about GCHQ's data-trawling techniques which were detailed in papers leaked by the whistleblower Edward Snowden. The groups claim that by collecting data on millions of people not under any suspicion GCHQ has infringed the privacy of British and European citizens. In a series of questions, the court has asked British ministers to explain why they think Britain's intelligence services have the right to solicit, receive, search, analyse, disseminate and store data intercepted by themselves, or by foreign spy agencies. The court says the UK needs to show this activity is \"within the law\" and \"necessary in a democratic society\". The case refers specifically to two surveillance programmes, Prism and Tempora. Between them, they allow GCHQ and its US counterpart, the National Security Agency to harvest, store and analyse data from millions of phone calls, emails and search engine queries. In the complaint to the court, the groups argued much of this activity is not underpinned by British law. They said there was no \"effective, independent authorisation and oversight\" of the programmes. The claim states: \"The interception of external communications by GCHQ is an inherently disproportionate interference with the private lives of thousands, perhaps millions of people.\" \"The European court of human rights has acted remarkably quickly in communicating the case to the government and designating it as a priority,\" said Daniel Carey, the lawyer acting for the groups. \"It has also acted decisively by requiring the government to explain how the UK's surveillance practices and oversight mechanisms comply with the right to privacy. This gives hope the ECHR will require reform if the government continues to insist that nothing is wrong.\" Nick Pickles of Big Brother Watch said: \"This legal challenge is an essential part of getting to the bottom of why the public and parliament have not been properly informed about the scale of surveillance and why our privacy has been subverted on an industrial scale.\" GCHQ and ministers have consistently denied that any of the programmes revealed by Snowden breach the law. GCHQ maintains its work \"is carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework which ensures that our activities are authorised, necessary and proportionate, and that there is rigorous oversight, including from the secretary of state, the Interception and Intelligence Services commissioners and the parliamentary intelligence and security committee\". William Hague, the foreign secretary, has also defended Britain's intelligence agencies, saying law-biding members of the public have \"nothing to fear\". \"If we could tell the whole world and the whole country how we do this business, I think people would be enormously reassured by it and they would see that the law-abiding citizen has nothing to worry about. \"This is secret work, it is secret intelligence, it is secret for a reason, and a reason that is to do with protecting all the people of this country.\" However, Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group, said it was now clear that British laws had been abused to give the agencies a chance \"to monitor everything and everyone almost constantly\".\n",

Sir Iain Lobban\u2019s consultancy with Shell and the holding company of Hakluyt & Co, a boutique corporate intelligence firm established by former MI6 spies, are among a series of private sector jobs the retired spook has taken up over the past year. Both roles are expected primarily to involve advising on risk and cybersecurity. Lobban has also accepted advisory positions at companies including C5 Capital, a multimillion-dollar venture capital fund focused on cybersecurity, and Cambridge Security Initiative, an intelligence consultancy established by Sir Richard Dearlove, the head of MI6 between 1999 and 2004. According to its website, recent clients of CSi include UK and US government agencies. The advisory committee on business appointments (Acoba), which reviews the jobs taken by former ministers and crown servants after they leave their posts, has approved each of the new roles on the condition that Lobban does not draw on privileged information available to him while in office, or advise on business dealings \u201crelating directly to the work of GCHQ\u201d for 12 months.\nBetween April and September, the committee published details of Lobban\u2019s appointments on its website. Rules explain that for two years after leaving office, a crown servant should not become personally involved in lobbying the UK government. There is no suggestion Lobban has breached any rules of the advisory committee. Details of the latest appointments come after the Guardian reported this week that Sir John Scarlett, the head of MI6 from 2004 to 2009, and Lord Carlile, the government\u2019s independent reviewer of national security policy in Northern Ireland, have each received \u00a3400,000 in dividends from a company they co-own. On Monday, Carlile defended the security and intelligence agencies and their bulk surveillance powers. His intervention came ahead of the government\u2019s publication on Wednesday of controversial draft legislation that permits mass surveillance activities by intelligence agencies and police. Lobban, who was at the helm of GCHQ as it came under intense pressure following the publication of Edward Snowden\u2019s revelations, defended bulk interception powers in July during a lecture he gave at King\u2019s College London, where he is a visiting professor. \u201cIt is impossible to provide a defensive cybersecurity apparatus without operating first at the level of bulk, then to winnow out the chaff,\u201d he said, echoing a widely criticised needle-in-a-haystack metaphor he used to describe GCHQ\u2019s work to MPs in the wake of the Snowden affair. In the lecture, Lobban attacked the media\u2019s critical coverage of the intelligence services in recent years, admitting that he had found it \u201chard to take\u201d. The former spy chief suggested that \u201cas the level of intrusiveness of what we do increases\u201d, intelligence agencies need to deal proactively with the press and better explain their capabilities and what they are used for. A spokeswoman for Shell confirmed that Lobban has been contracted to advise the company\u2019s board on cybersecurity issues. She said: \u201cSir Iain is a leading figure in this field, and Shell is just one of a number of companies he advises on such matters.\u201d Earlier this year, Shell said it would roll out a cybersecurity programme amid rising threats from hackers to its infrastructure around the world. From time to time, Shell has drawn on the services of Hakluyt, the Mayfair-based intelligence company. Separately from his work with Shell, Lobban will sit on the advisory board of Hakluyt\u2019s holding company, the Holdingham Group, alongside senior business figures including the former chairmen of Rolls-Royce, GlaxoSmithKline and Unilever. Lobban joins a succession of former spies and diplomats who have become associated with Hakluyt since it was formed nearly 20 years ago. It draws on a network of associates around the world who provide regional and local information, making the company popular among its blue-chip clients. Hakluyt staff include numerous former senior government advisers, and in recent years the company has met and dined with top civil servants including the cabinet secretary, Jeremy Heywood, and David Cameron\u2019s national security adviser, Kim Darroch, who stepped down in September. A spokesman for Hakluyt, which declined the Guardian\u2019s request for an interview, said the company does not talk to the press. Lobban declined to comment when approached by the Guardian. A spokesman said he had acted in accordance with the government\u2019s rules, submitting all his applications for independent advice from Acoba and following that advice. Earlier this year, Standard Chartered bank announced it had appointed Lobban as an adviser to its financial crime risk committee. Lobban is also advising the Australian government on a national cybersecurity review.\n",

        "body": "The UK's most secretive court is beginning a week-long hearing \u2013 mostly in public \u2013 into complaints that GCHQ's mass surveillance of the internet violates human rights. The case against the monitoring agency at the investigatory powers tribunal (IPT) is the result of revelations by the US whistleblower Edward Snowden. It has been brought by Privacy International, Liberty, Amnesty International, the American Civil Liberties Union and a number of other overseas human rights groups. The legal challenge is the first of dozens of GCHQ-related claims to be examined in detail by the IPT, which hears complaints against British intelligence agencies and government bodies that carry out surveillance under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa). The civil liberties organisations are concerned that their private communications may have been monitored under GCHQ's electronic surveillance programme Tempora, whose existence was revealed by Snowden. They also complain that information obtained through the US National Security Agency's Prism and Upstream programmes may have been shared with the British intelligence services, sidestepping protections provided by the UK legal system. On 10 July the government announced emergency measures to preserve the legality of data retention and at the same time promised a review of how Ripa operates. James Welch, Liberty's legal director, said: \"As legislation is introduced to paper over one crack in the crumbling surveillance state, another faces challenge. Not content with forcing service providers to keep details of our calls and browsing histories, the government is fighting to retain the right to trawl through our communications with anyone outside and many inside the country. When will it learn that it is neither ethical nor efficient to turn everyone into suspects?\" Most IPT hearings are conducted behind closed doors. Since the tribunal was established 14 years ago, no complaint against the intelligence services has ever been upheld. There is no appeal against the court's decisions although the European court of human rights in Strasbourg has signalled that it will consider appeals from the IPT on the presumption that claimants have exhausted domestic remedies. Mr Justice Burton, who became president of the court last October, describes it as an \"open tribunal\" and has vowed to make its procedures less clandestine. In a departure from previous practice, the IPT posted advance notice of this week's hearing on its website, explaining that the case is \"against the intelligence agencies in respect of alleged interception activity involving UK and US access to communications\". In defence documents already submitted, the government's most senior security official, Charles Farr, has explained how searches on Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, as well as emails to or from non-British citizens abroad, can be monitored legally by the security services without obtaining an individual warrant because they are deemed to be \"external communications\". The IPT hearing, at the Rolls Building in central London, may hear some of the most sensitive evidence about interceptions in private. This claim is expected to concentrate on the legality of two interception programmes, Tempora and Prism, and their use by the UK's monitoring agency, GCHQ, and its US counterpart, the NSA. In Farr's submission, he says he can \"neither confirm or deny\" the existence of Tempora, although he does acknowledge that Prism exists \"because it has been expressly avowed by the executive branch of the US government\". Much of the tribunal's deliberations will therefore have to proceed on the basis of agreed hypothetical facts. For example, if Tempora exists, lawyers will ask, does it violate the rights to privacy and freedom of expression enshrined in articles 8 and 10 of the European convention on human rights?\n",

Uh, no \u2026 Britain\u2019s GCHQ surveillance agency has made a rare foray into public commentary after becoming part of the conspiracy theory that Barack Obama wiretapped Donald Trump. Sean Spicer, seeking to bolster the president\u2019s unsupported allegation, has repeated a claim (made on Fox News, attributed to shadowy people) that Britain carried out the bugging so there were \u201cno American fingerprints on this\u201d.

After her house was hit, she grabbed on to wood and tree branches while being swept along. Cows and pigs belonging to D\u00edaz were also rescued from the muddy torrent. * * * Deadly strike on Syria mosque \u2013 More than 40 people were killed when warplanes bombed a mosque west of Aleppo during worship last night, observers said. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said another 100 people were injured. Israeli jets, meanwhile, have come under fire from pro-Assad forces during a sortie over Syria.

Paul Chichester, the director for operations at the GCHQ-controlled body, said the companies must recognise their \u201csocial responsibility\u201d and help tackle misinformation spread by state-backed groups. He said: \u201cWe don\u2019t own those platforms, we don\u2019t run them, the industry does. It\u2019s really important that they do recognise they carry some social responsibility. \u201cTechnology companies, they\u2019re huge global companies with responsibilities of nation states sometimes to tackle some of these problems.\u201d The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), which officially opened on 14 February, has said protecting the integrity of Britain\u2019s electoral democratic systems is one of its top priorities following the hacking of the Democratic party in the US last year. Facebook has come under particular scrutiny after a proliferation of fake news stories went viral during the US presidential election campaign, including one story that claimed the pope had endorsed Donald Trump.\nThe social network is testing a way to flag news deemed to be fake but government officials, including the EU\u2019s digital chief, Andrus Ansip, have urged them to take a stronger stance or face action from Brussels. Asked on Tuesday whether social networks could do more to tackle the rising tide of fake news, Chichester said: \u201cI think so. It\u2019s an emerging threat that we\u2019re all grappling with. It\u2019s not just a challenge for government. \u201cI think you can see some of the social media companies already looking at tackling some of that. \u201cI think perhaps they feel they\u2019ve been exploited and they\u2019re looking to tackle that as well. Actually, I think it currently looks like an area we can collaborate and work together with industry to tackle this.\u201d Chichester was speaking in Liverpool on the fringes of the NCSC\u2019s first cybersecurity summit, hailed Cyber UK. Security was tight at the three-day event for intelligence and cybersecurity professionals. A small number of journalists was allowed to watch a keynote address by Robert Hannigan, the outgoing GCHQ director, before being ushered out. The government-run conference comes a week after WikiLeaks published what it claimed was the biggest leak of confidential documents from the CIA, detailing the tools it uses to break into phones, smart televisions and other communication devices. Chichester would not be drawn on the implications of the leak for the British intelligence agencies, but said cyber-criminals would seek to take advantage from any vulnerabilities disclosed in the leak.\nHe said: \u201cFor us any leak of data, or any leak of vulnerabilities, in an uncontrolled way, whoever does it doesn\u2019t help the security industry. We believe in responsible disclosure. We believe in if you understand vulnerabilities you have ways to disclose them responsibly. I wouldn\u2019t in any way shape or form endorse the mass leaking of anything like that. \u201cCybercriminals will always be looking for new techniques. They\u2019ll certainly be keen to look at how they can use them. Any time when somebody discloses potentially new ways of attacking systems then the criminals are going to be really keen to weaponise them before people have had a chance to fix them.\u201d\n",

        "body": "Many couples living in Australian residential aged care are unable to have normal sexual relationships because of systemic and unnecessary surveillance and illegal breaches of their privacy, a study from the University of New England has found. Vehement opposition from religious conservatives means parliaments have failed to strengthen legislation that protects the rights of elderly citizens, according to the study to be published this month in the journal Elder Law Review. \u201cCouples may be separated or provided with single beds only, unable to push them together,\u201d the paper says.\n\u201cStaff frequently enter without knocking, commonly ignore \u2018do not disturb\u2019 signs and often gossip about residents. Some Australian aged-care facilities will still segregate sexes, including married couples, and many ignore the needs of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and interest residents.\u201d The lead author of the paper, from the university\u2019s school of behavioural, cognitive and social sciences, Alison Rahn, said facilities often went too far in their attempts to prevent elder abuse in aged care. There was no mandatory staff training about how to respect and respond to consensual sexual relationships between residents. \u201cThe charter of residents rights was instituted in the late 1980s and the original version protected the sexual rights of residents,\u201d Rahn said. \u201cBut the Catholic church made sure that was expunged. However, the charter still says their privacy must be respected and they have the right to socialise with whoever they choose and to take risks. \u201cYou could read into that to say residents have the right to have their relationships protected, but the reality is much different in most facilities, which are commonly run by religious institutions and charities.\u201d The paper calls for specific human rights legislation for older Australians, a measure advocated for by the Australian Human Rights Commission, and for the Aged Care Act to be strengthened to protect couples entering aged care together and those who form relationships after entering aged care.\nRahn\u2019s research is based on existing reports and studies, interviews with people working in the aged care sector, and 170 responses to an anonymous online survey asking people about their aged-care experiences. \u201cI\u2019m stunned that in this day and age we have draconian practices you would expect to see in 18th century England,\u201d she said. \u201cIn some facilities, and I stress only some, a bathing method that has become popular for efficiency reasons is wheeling a trolley into a resident\u2019s room, stripping them naked, placing them stark naked in a kiddies bathing pool on top of the trolley, and hosing them down, sometimes in front of other people. \u201cI\u2019m astounded to hear these things. Some people who are asked to work in aged care facilities may be coming from backgrounds where they are very demure and conservative about sexuality, and these same people are being asked to wash and bathe people. They get the shock of their lives if they walk in on residents having a sexual experience.\u201d She also knew of institutions where the policy was for residents\u2019 doors to be open at all times. Rooms in aged-care facilities needed to be built large enough to allow for double beds, she said, and institutionalised separation of couples once they entered aged care should be stopped. Councils on the Ageing chief executive, Ian Yates, said the process of giving bed licences and funding to providers should also be stopped. Instead, consumers should have the right to choose where their residential care funding is allocated, and to move it if they are unhappy. \u201cThat way, people can put their money towards providers with a track record of providing privacy and respect, and those facilities will have the funding to expand, while other less ethical providers will go out of business,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe will see a lot more respect given to consumers that way, and this has actually been recommended by the Productivity Commission already.\u201d Privacy was an ongoing issue for people in aged care, Yates said. But a significant cultural shift was needed to improve their treatment. \u201cIn our society we tend to infantilise older people and the notion of sexuality among many old people is something that many younger people find embarrassing to contemplate and talk about,\u201d he said. \u201cBut living in residential facilities you\u2019re supposed to be afforded the same respect you\u2019d get in your own home. Facilities failing to cater for couples is a continuing complaint in the sector. \u201cBut unless someone is clearly at risk, what they\u2019re doing with their time is their business.\u201d\n",

        "body": "British political parties have approached the surveillance agency GCHQ for advice on beefing up their internet security after a cyber-attack during the 2015 UK general election and the hacking in the US last year of the Democratic party. Ciaran Martin, head of the UK\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre, which is part of GCHQ and was officially opened on Tuesday, confirmed informal contact had been made by the parties and that he expected to be asked formally to provide advice on how to increase their digital security. He did not specify which parties had made approaches. The idea of political parties engaging with the intelligence services is a sensitive issue. But such concern is being pushed aside by fears of the impact of a major hack along the lines of that in the US last year, which caused huge damage and embarrassment to the Democrats. Russian state hackers have been blamed by US intelligence. Asked if any UK parties had asked for help, Martin said: \u201cThere is talk about it and we are ready to work [with them]. We have had some approaches and we would expect to be offering seminars and that sort of thing for political parties in the future. Have not done it yet. But we would expect to. But only if they asked.\u201d When asked if they had made such a request, he replied: \u201cnot formally\u201d. Martin was speaking to journalists after the official opening by the Queen of the new centre, which has been set up as the public face of GCHQ and that is intended to give advice to businesses, members of the public and others worried about cybersecurity. He said there had been a step-up in cyber-attacks on the west over the past two years and, with elections this year in the Netherlands, France and Germany, there was concern about protecting the democratic process. \u201cAcross the west we are on the alert and looking at defences in that sort of area of the electoral process.\u201d Asked about concerns over interference in the British political system by potential hacking of political parties, Martin said: \u201cSo what I would say is that protecting the integrity of the electoral democratic systems is up there with the top priorities. Of course it is. But it is not just a question of something happens to the Democratic National Committee, therefore we look at the corporate networks of British political parties.\n\u201cYou have to look at the totality of this,\u201d he said, adding that it was not just about the security of the parties but the political system as a whole. \u201cOf course, we will try to look at political parties. But we support the parliamentary authorities at their request because we are constitutionally different from parliament. \u201cWe look at what is going on in government networks. We did a huge amount of work in the last parliament when there was the move to online and individual electoral registration to protect that system. And also, frankly, we give advice, a brochure, to every parliamentarian after [their] election and we advise generically people with high public profiles on what they need to do in their personal electronic lives.\u201d The chief technical director of the new cybersecurity centre, Ian Levy, said that political parties were set up like medium-sized enterprises and constituency parties like small enterprises. The kind of advice given to medium-size and small enterprises could be given to political parties, he added. Levy said one of the first initiatives of the new centre would be publication of guidance on selecting a good password manager to make access easier. \u201cAcross everybody\u2019s private and work life, all the different services they have, all the different passwords, the average complexity and the average change interval, broadly speaking, it\u2019s the same as asking somebody to remember a different 600-digit number every month. \u201cWhen I say it\u2019s dumb, that\u2019s why I say it\u2019s dumb.\u201d Earlier, Levy showed the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh around, including a room of household appliances that could be vulnerable to security breaches, including a vacuum cleaner, a doll and a coffee maker. The vacuum cleaner had a camera inside that could be accessed by the manufacturer. \u201cIt is a horrendous device,\u201d Levy said. The Queen seemed amused. The Conservative party has tended to be closer to the intelligence community down the decades than Labour, where there is a residue of suspicion. During the cold war, leftwingers were often targets of surveillance by the intelligence services. Advice from the cybersecurity service would not be foolproof, although such advice might have helped the Democratic party to avoid being hacked. More problematic would have been personal emails such as those of the chairman of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, John Podesta, which would have required him to take personal security precautions.\nCiaran Martin: cybersecurity chief brings GCHQ out of the shadows One of the most senior members of GCHQ, Ciaran Martin, was showing a visitor around its ultra-secret headquarters in Cheltenham. He remarked on the irony that as a Northern Ireland catholic he himself might not have been allowed inside the building a generation or so back. Against the background of the Troubles, Martin would probably have been viewed with suspicion as a potential security threat. With relative peace in Northern Ireland since the 1998 Good Friday agreement, not only was he allowed inside but since joining in February 2014 he has occupied a series of key roles. That is not the only sign of the changing nature of GCHQ. Until recently, his name would have been treated as a secret. Only the director\u2019s name was made public. As the first head of the UK\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre, Martin\u2019s role is to leave the shadows and to be out and about in public, giving media interviews, making speeches, engaging with companies and anyone else concerned about digital security. Representatives from about 100 companies will be invited to join the centre on secondment to learn about digital security.\nOpinion within GCHQ is divided about this new direction, with some staff uncomfortable, after years of ingrained secrecy, with such a public posture. Others accept that in the post-Snowden world such engagement with the public is probably essential. Martin, who is in his early 40s and graduated with a first in history from Hertford College, Oxford, has enjoyed a stellar career in government. He has worked for three years at the National Audit Office, six at the Treasury and eight years at the Cabinet Office, where his roles included director of security and intelligence and constitution director, helping to prepare for the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. He quickly made an impact as head of cybersecurity with a speech in Washington in September arguing the case for creating a \u201cGreat British Firewall\u201d as a defence against hackers. Although officially opened on Tuesday, the cyber centre, which is opposite Victoria station in London, is still far from finished, with the ranks of computer screens that will occupy one floor yet to be installed. The office may not be fully equipped and be up and running until the end of the year. Staff describe Martin as easygoing. Unlike previous intelligence mandarins with their coveted offices, he has no office and no desk \u2013 at least not yet. When he gets in to work in the morning he just sits at the first empty desk.\n",

The criticism by rapporteur Joseph Cannataci is made in a report presented to the UN Human Rights Council. The report deals with privacy concerns worldwide but Cannataci, concerned about developments in the UK, has devoted a section to the British bill. He says the British government has failed to recognise the consequences of legitimising bulk data collection or mass surveillance. Instead of legitimising it, the government should be outlawing it, he says. MPs are scheduled to vote on the second reading of the investigatory powers bill next week. The bill is in part a response to the revelations of whistleblower Edward Snowden in 2013 about the scale of bulk data collection by intelligence agencies in the UK and US. The bill enshrines in law a host of surveillance powers the intelligence services had kept largely hidden from the public for the last two decades, including computer hacking. In contrast with the US, which last year banned bulk data phone collection, the UK is keeping all its surveillance powers. Cannataci, in the report, expresses serious concern and calls on MPs to use their influence to ensure \u201cthat disproportionate, privacy-intrusive measures such as bulk surveillance and bulk hacking as contemplated in the investigatory powers bill be outlawed rather an legitimised.\u201d He notes the influence the UK has over the commonwealth and calls on it to step back from taking disproportionate measures which could have \u201cnegative ramifications beyond the shores of the United Kingdom\u201d. He also urges the UK to show greater commitment to privacy and \u201cto desist from setting a bad example to other states by continuing to propose measures, especially bulk interception and bulk hacking\u201d which run counter to recent European court judgments and \u201cundermine the spirit of the very right to privacy\u201d. Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group, welcomed the report and described the bill as deeply flawed. \u201cThe special rapporteur\u2019s report is yet another damning criticism of the investigatory powers bill. Not only does it call for the disproportionate powers in the bill to be outlawed rather than legitimised, it points out that the bill does not comply with recent human rights rulings, which means it could be open to legal challenges. \u201cThe report voices another serious concern \u2013 that the impact of this extreme legislation will be felt around the world, and copied by other countries.\u201d\n",

Following revelations last year that police departments had gained special access to the social networks to track protesters, Facebook, which owns Instagram, announced on Monday that it had updated its rules to state that developers could not \u201cuse data obtained from us to provide tools that are used for surveillance\u201d.\nThe news is a victory for civil liberties groups, which have increasingly raised concerns about mass surveillance and aggressive prosecutions of activists under Donald Trump\u2019s administration. \u201cIt\u2019s very important right now that tech companies like Facebook take a stand to be human rights champions, because otherwise they\u2019ll be used to violate human rights,\u201d said Malkia Cyril, executive director of the Center for Media Justice, part of a coalition that pushed for the anti-surveillance reforms. The American Civil Liberties Union obtained government records last year revealing that Facebook, Instagram and Twitter had provided users\u2019 data to a software company that aids police surveillance programs and had helped law enforcement monitor Black Lives Matter demonstrations. The ACLU found that the social networking sites had given \u201cspecial access\u201d to Geofeedia, a controversial startup that has partnered with law enforcement to track streams of user content. In response to the revelations, the tech companies cut off Geofeedia\u2019s access, though activist groups, including Color of Change, have continued to push for a broader policy restricting these kinds of collaborations. \u201cOur goal is to make our policy explicit,\u201d Facebook said in its announcement on Monday. \u201cOver the past several months we have taken enforcement action against developers who created and marketed tools meant for surveillance, in violation of our existing policies; we want to be sure everyone understands the underlying policy and how to comply.\u201d The ACLU praised the policy reform and said: \u201cWritten policies must be backed up by rigorous oversight and swift action for violations.\u201d \u201cNow more than ever, we expect companies to slam shut any surveillance side doors and make sure nobody can use their platforms to target people of color and activists,\u201d Nicole Ozer, technology and civil liberties director at the ACLU of California, said in a statement. The ACLU\u2019s previous investigations had found that social media surveillance software companies had referred to unions and activists as \u201covert threats\u201d and that one police agency in California used tools to track South Asian, Muslim and Sikh protesters.\nIn December, ACLU findings also prompted Twitter to block federally funded \u201cdomestic spy centers\u201d from using certain social media monitoring technology. \u201cWe need to see a situation where activists don\u2019t even have to prompt Facebook to take action,\u201d Cyril said. \u201cWe need to see real consistent and clear enforcement \u2026 When the pressure becomes greater, we need to see them stand firm.\u201d Stories of police targeting protests using social media have become increasingly common. Last week, law enforcement in Washington state obtained a warrant to search a Facebook community page associated with the high-profile protest against the Dakota Access pipeline. The warrant served on Facebook, which the ACLU is challenging, sought personal and private information about users. Cyril said the policy change could push other firms to better protect users\u2019 privacy. \u201cWe hope Facebook will encourage other tech companies to refuse to share data for the purposes of wide-scale government surveillance.\u201d\n",

        "body": "Internal US law enforcement documents describe a highly controversial community initiative aimed at identifying potential terrorists before they \u201cradicalize\u201d as being intimately related to intelligence gathering. Despite years of official denials, American Muslim civil rights groups have claimed that Barack Obama\u2019s Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) initiative was a euphemistic approach that targeted Muslims for surveillance. The FBI described the CVE program as designed to \u201cstrengthen our investigative, intelligence gathering and collaborative abilities to be proactive in countering violent extremism\u201d. The description was made in an August 2016 document about an upcoming CVE training conference which has been revealed by a freedom of information request. Under Donald Trump\u2019s administration, the Department of Homeland Security is reviewing the effort with a mind to rebrand it \u201cCountering Radical Islam\u201d or \u201cCountering Violent Jihad\u201d.\nRegardless of its name, the program has \u201cin practice, focused almost exclusively on American Muslim communities\u201d, according to a new study by the Brennan Center for Justice, which acquired the internal documentation under the Freedom of Information Act. Civil rights critics see the Obama-era CVE initiative as laying the groundwork for a Trump-era crackdown on American Muslims. \u201cThe Obama administration portrayed CVE as a community-led approach to addressing terrorism and strenuously denied that it was a surveillance program. But law enforcement agencies charged with investigating and prosecuting terrorism \u2013 such as US attorneys, the FBI, and local police \u2013 sit at the center of these programs and see them as a way to collect information about Muslims who are not suspected of any crime,\u201d said Faiza Patel, the lead author of the Brennan Center study. In the Obama era, CVE was framed as a community partnership with the government. With grant money and government support, local leaders were encouraged to spot the warning signs of radicalization and equipped to prevent at-risk youth from going over the edge into violence, ostensibly as an alternative to prosecution. Administration officials strenuously denied both an outsized focus on Muslims and that CVE functioned as an intelligence effort. But for American Muslims and civil libertarians, the defining structural features of CVE is the prominence of law enforcement within the program and a feeling of stigmatization because of it. US attorneys, the FBI and police play a conspicuous role in CVE. While tabulating CVE grant money is difficult because much remains out of public view, the Brennan Center estimates that a third of recipients are \u201cpolice and public service agencies and policing research institutions\u201d. According to the August FBI document, CVE efforts \u201cwill be aligned with operational divisions to provide support for existing threat mitigation efforts\u201d. The bureau\u2019s partners are a \u201cmyriad of law enforcement offices\u201d, including the \u201cInternational Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), major city chiefs [and] major county sheriffs\u201d, while outreach efforts \u201callow for developing relationships with civic leaders, community organizations and academia\u201d. The Brennan Center notes that none of the CVE material it obtained from federal or local law enforcement rules out sharing information gleaned from CVE with police or homeland security departments. CVE is analogous, the Brennan Center writes, to a highly controversial program by the UK government called Prevent, which encourages local institutions like schools to report signs of radicalization. UK Muslims report feeling stigmatized by a program that they say encourages teachers, doctors and social workers into informing on them. The FBI also appears internally inconsistent on whether radicalization leads to terrorism at all, a thesis terrorism researchers tend to consider overly simplistic. The August 2016 document calls for being \u201cproactive\u201d in addressing \u201ccatalysts leading to radicalization and mobilization\u201d.\nBut its 2015-era Strategic Plan to Curb Violent Extremism, also unearthed by the Brennan Center, instructs: \u201cThere is neither one path or personality type which is prone to adopting extremist views [or] exhibiting violent tendencies.\u201d In internal documents, CVE guidance on the warning signs of terrorist behavior covers a range of first amendment-protected speech and conflates political dissent with potential violence. Such signs, according to a CVE program in Maryland\u2019s Montgomery County, include a sense that the west is at war with Islam due to \u201cUS interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq, drone attacks in Pakistan, the establishment of military bases in Muslim majority countries, human rights abuses against Muslims in Guantanamo Bay, civil rights infringements, US support for Israel, and Washington\u2019s reluctance to support regime change in authoritarian states in the Middle East\u201d. Other potential warning signs on display in CVE documents include feelings of alienation, hopelessness and injustice, which the Brennan Center notes are \u201cnot predictive of violence and would raise no suspicion if found in non-Muslims\u201d. The fate of CVE in the Trump administration is unclear. The FBI declined to comment and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to questions, including about the potential rebranding to explicitly focus on Muslims. \u201cWhile much has been made of proposals to change the name of the program to focus explicitly on \u2018radical Islam\u2019, CVE has always been about Muslims,\u201d said the Brennan Center\u2019s Patel. \u201cIts underlying premise \u2013 which ignores the incidence of rightwing violence \u2013 is that American Muslim communities require special handling because of their susceptibility to terrorism. It is part of a continuum of stereotypes about Muslims as inherently violent that has culminated in the Trump administration\u2019s obvious antipathy to Islam.\u201d\n",

        "body": "One of the oddities in Donald Trump\u2019s wiretapping claims is how antiquated is his view of how the security services work in the digital age.\nIn tweets on Saturday, the president claimed that Barack Obama had ordered a wiretap of Trump Tower in October ahead of November\u2019s election. \u201cHow low has President gone to tapp [sic] my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!\u201d Trump\u2019s tweets suggest he is stuck is a cold-war time warp, with spies still using the kind of techniques found in John le Carr\u00e9 novels rather than 21st-century surveillance. The US security agencies \u2013 whether the FBI, CIA or one of a dozen others \u2013 no longer have to engage in wiretapping of the kind that Trump hints at. Until a decade or so ago, a wiretap meant connecting to a target\u2019s landline or placing bugs in a house. Security staff might have to break in during the night or turn up during the day pretending to be cleaners or phone engineers, placing bugs directly into phones or under tables or hiding miniature cameras in light fittings. For the security services, old-fashioned phone-tapping operations were risky. A bug might be found. A suspicious click might be heard during a phone conversation, alerting the target. And there was always the danger of being caught \u2013 as during the Watergate scandal, which Trump referred to in one of his tweets. In 1972 burglars working on behalf of president Richard Nixon\u2019s re-election campaign broke into the Democratic party headquarters in Washington, and successfully installed a listening device on at least one phone. Things went wrong when they decided they had to break in a second time to carry out repairs and were caught.\nBut there is no need for such risks these days. As this week\u2019s Wikileaks CIA dump confirmed, the past two decades have been a golden age for the security services, courtesy of the digital revolution. There would have been no need to break into Trump Tower. The security agencies can access electronic devices across the planet with ease. They can listen in to a target\u2019s mobile, even if it is switched off. If the target is paranoid and stuffs the mobile into a microwave or fridge freezer to render it inert, the security services can pick up the target\u2019s conversations by switching to the mobiles of others in the vicinity. The standout detail from the latest leak is that the CIA had a programme called Weeping Angel which described how to attack a Samsung F8000 TV set so that it appears to be off but could still be used for monitoring.\nThey can access just about anyone\u2019s computer or laptop, again even those that are turned off. The same for cameras on computers and laptops, which can also be switched on remotely. The technology to turn on smart phones remotely has been around for at least a decade. A former CIA cyber-security specialist has explained how the security services can set up a cell network tower and, once a phone connects, they can take it over. They can mimic the process of the phone closing down and make it appear blank, whereas, in reality, a mic remains live. A former FBI specialist has said that the ability to use cameras on computers and laptops has also been available for at least a decade. The security services can use malware to take control of the camera, ensuring there is no light or any other indication that would allow a person to know they are being watched. Who needs wiretaps when there are so many potential listening devices around these days? Even the word \u201cwiretap\u201d is antiquated. The security services and privacy advocates are more likely now to talk about \u201cinterception\u201d, a more accurate description of what they do. Trump has offered no evidence to back up his claim. The recently retired director of national intelligence James Clapper said the Obama-ordered wiretapping did not happen, though Clapper is an unreliable witness, having misled Congress in 2013 by stating there was no mass surveillance in the US. FBI director James Comey also denies the claim but Comey, too, is tainted, given his late intervention in the election race with damaging comments about Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. Denials from Obama\u2019s own national security team are more credible, not least because \u2013 though a president enjoys sweeping powers \u2013 he cannot order the security services to mount the kind of operation Trump has in mind.\nWiretaps are as old as electronic communications. The telegraph began to come into use in the 1840s. Almost two decades later, during the American civil war, it became commonplace for both sides to climb telegraph poles and tap into communications. Abraham Lincoln, in spite of nods towards privacy, was an avid reader of intercepted communications. The arrival of the phone in the 1870s offered new opportunities. Throughout the 20th century, police regularly used wiretaps to trap criminals, while the intelligence services targeted those who were deemed to be threats to national security. During the cold war, diplomats as a matter of routine assumed their phones were tapped and their offices bugged, and not just Americans based in Moscow or Beijing, but all around the world. CIA officers based in embassies almost always had a safe room that had been swept for bugs and where sensitive conversations could be held in relative security. While the Watergate conspiracy is the most infamous US case involving wiretapping and politics, equally infamous is the list of operations conducted in the 1960s and 1970s by the CIA and FBI. The targets included prominent individuals seen as potentially undermining national security, including anti-Vietnam war protesters, trade unionists and journalists.\nAmong those was Martin Luther King, who the head of the FBI, Edgar Hoover, suspected of being influenced by communists. Hoover asked the then attorney-general Robert Kennedy in 1963 to authorise surveillance requests to install bugs in his home, office and hotels where he stayed on trips. No evidence ever emerged linking King to communism, but they did record at least one sexual encounter. Throughout the 20th century there were intermittent challenges in Congress and the courts attempting to redress the balance between intrusive surveillance and the right to privacy. Amid the panic in the Bush administration in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, the president secretly sanctioned \u201cwarrantless wiretapping\u201d \u2013 surveillance of phones, the internet and any other electronic communications without the need for a warrant. When this was revealed in the New York Times in 2005, the Bush administration reversed the order and there was a return to warrants. This row was dwarfed in 2013 when the National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed the scale of mass surveillance \u2013 the agencies prefer bulk data collection \u2013 not only of foreigners but of US citizens, which the intelligence agencies had publicly denied up until that point. Among the many intercept programmes revealed by Snowden was Tempora, run by the NSA\u2019s UK counterpart GCHQ, and shared with the Americans. This was a kind of wiretap on a scale that would have been beyond the imagination of the American civil war soldiers who climbed telegraph poles, or the FBI agents breaking into King\u2019s hotel room to plant a bug. GCHQ placed intercepts on the network of fibre-optic cables that carry much of the world\u2019s internet traffic, offering a window into the world of an estimated two billion users of the worldwide web. The US intelligence agencies have so far made a distinction when denying surveillance of Trump. There have been no denials about surveillance of those associates who might have been in contact with Russians. Those kind of contacts would be relatively easy to establish, not through break-ins or even physical surveillance \u2013 which has not been made redundant by the digital age, with agencies running teams trained in following targets without, hopefully, being seen. With so much information hoovered up and available to the agencies, all they have to do is sift through those communications to establish the extent \u2013 if any \u2013 of links between Russia and Trump\u2019s team.\n",

        "body": "School lunch lines in the UK can be fraught: students receiving free lunches may not want their peers to know, lost payment cards mean some go without, and code-based payments leave children at risk of \u201cshoulder surfing\u201d, where others spot their number and use it to buy their own meal. Fingerprint scanners are being presented as one solution for doing away with this stress. They can be linked to online payments, making busy lunchtimes easier and faster, plus it will save schools from printing ID cards. A typical secondary school in the UK can end up producing more than 400 new payment cards every year to account for lost, damaged and new intake ones, says Nigel Walker, managing director of biometrics company BioStore. \u201cBiometrics can\u2019t be lost or forgotten, stolen or used by someone else. \u201cWhen students and staff identify themselves on the system, you can be sure it\u2019s them. This improves a school\u2019s safety in terms of access, security and accountability.\u201d The Department for Education doesn\u2019t track how many schools use biometric systems, but in 2014, campaigning group Big Brother Watch estimated that more than a million secondary schoolchildren had handed over their fingerprints. In these hi-tech schools, biometrics \u2013 in particular fingerprints but also palm prints \u2013 can be used for entering and exiting the main school building as well as classrooms and buses, taking attendance, and accessing lockers, computers, library books and printers. Add in other new technologies such as wearables, and civil rights campaigners fear the result is that surveillance is quietly being normalised in children from a young age. Normalising surveillance The Protections of Freedoms Act 2012 states that schoolchildren cannot have their fingerprints taken without written parental consent. Until then even the youngest of students may have had their biometric data captured. \u201cThere is no need to retrospectively gain this consent so many children are having their data processed without their, or their parents\u2019, consent,\u201d says Emmeline Taylor, author of Surveillance Schools. Daniel Nesbitt, research director at Big Brother Watch, says that parents and children must understand what is going to happen with the information, how it will be used and where it will be stored. \u201cWithout this information, they can\u2019t give informed consent,\u201d he says. \u201cThe immediate issue is that children may be monitored across a range of areas \u2013 potentially including what they are eating to which library books they take out \u2013 and this could normalise the idea of surveillance or being tracked from an early age,\u201d Nesbitt adds. Taylor agrees: \u201cThose that experience surveillance in a school are semi-captive, and the fact that the same individuals inhabit the same space on a daily basis means that surveillance forms part of their lived environment, as commonplace and mundane as the blackboard at the front of the classroom.\u201d Keeping data safe Others wary of using biometrics in schools point to the challenges around security. \u201cThe risks include the data being leaked, hacked or misused by the school,\u201d says Pam Cowburn, communications director for the Open Rights Group. \u201cSchools need to think about how data is collected, stored and used. Who can access it? What could happen if it were leaked?\u201d Some companies say encryption helps make these systems safe. With its PalmSecure biometrics system, Japanese company Fujitsu, collects an image of the entire hand, encrypting the data. \u201cEach sensor provides a unique encryption algorithm, so even if you stole the encrypted templates, the information would be useless,\u201d says Kent Schrock, marketing executive at Fujitsu. BioStore, meanwhile, holds student scans in a dedicated, encrypted database, promising to delete it \u2013 not just overwrite it \u2013 when it is no longer in use. Such encryption is advised by the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office, but understanding the finer points of information security may be beyond school staff and parents, putting the onus on companies to keep data safe. Fear of falling behind Proponents argue that biometric systems can keep school buildings secure, help battle truancy and even encourage healthy eating. However, Taylor says she has seen little evidence of this and is concerned schools will feel under pressure to adopt the technology. \u201cAs some schools introduce tracking devices to supposedly increase efficiencies, safeguard students and respond to issues such as truancy and obesity, other schools quickly follow suit through fear of otherwise being regarded as negligent of their responsibilities,\u201d says Taylor. \u201cThe only beneficiaries are the companies selling the equipment. Once these systems are viewed as necessary, then any cost, whether financial or social, becomes worth the trade. It is an ingenious strategy to turn limited public funds into private profits.\u201d\n",

        "body": "WikiLeaks revelations about CIA surveillance operations threw into the public domain another set of odd-sounding codenames. The surveillance programme that caught the most attention, about how agents can make a television look as if it is off while in fact it is recording conversations, is known as Weeping Angel. The WikiLeaks trove also gives us Brutal Kangaroo, Fine Dining, HammerDrill and HarpyEagle. It has been suggested that Weeping Angel was inspired by the humanoids in Doctor Who. It might seem like an odd choice by American intelligence officials, but the Time Lord is well known in the US, where the programme long ago achieved cult status. Britain\u2019s intelligence agency MI5 collaborated with the CIA on developing the snooping programme, so the inspiration could equally well have come from the UK side. Both the US and British intelligence agencies insist that codenames are not selected on the basis of the personal whims of those involved. Instead, they say, they are randomly chosen by computer. But these names are often taken from popular culture. In the age before computers, the intelligence services insisted that codenames were decided at random. Nevertheless, codenames given to MI6 and MI5 agents in the 30s and 40s frequently reflected the personality traits of those agents. During the second world war, the Germans used codenames that offered a hint of what a secret operation was about, but the Americans and British used random lists of words, though politicians, the military and intelligence officers involved were allowed to select from such lists. Why were they allowed a choice? One later US military operation, the US intervention in Panama in 1989, was originally codenamed Blue Spoon but, after deciding it would be hard to boast about having fought in Blue Spoon, the military quickly renamed it Just Cause. The mass leak by Edward Snowden of the National Security Agency surveillance programmes provided hundreds of codenames, again seemingly chosen at random: Bullrun, Boundless Informant, Prism, Tempora, Royal Concierge, the Three Smurfs, and so on. There seems no obvious connection to the programmes involved, although the inclusion of the Three Smurfs is further evidence that the agencies are happy to borrow from popular culture. Of the Three Smurfs, Dreamy Smurf was aimed at turning on smart phones, Nosey Smurf at turning on a phone\u2019s mic, and Tracker Smurf at monitoring personal information, including locations. Tempora, the programme developed by the UK\u2019s GCHQ to tap into fibre-optic cables carrying internet traffic, could have been lifted from Cicero\u2019s quote \u201cO tempora o mores\u201d (\u201cOh, what times. Oh, what customs\u201d). Royal Concierge was a system used for tracking hotel bookings. The US security service offers incoming presidents a list of codenames that are again randomly chosen. Reagan went for Rawhide, a reference to a popular television western. Obama went for Renegade. Trump has plumped for Mogul.\n",

Where you can pound down a southern-fried chicken sandwich, crab fries and a po\u2019 boy sandwich, wash it down with a Bud Light, the Official Beer Sponsor of Super Bowl 50, and then have your body mass index checked by the Official Super Bowl 50 Host Committee Medical Team, aka Kaiser Permanente. Where $25 gets you a wine tasting, $10 buys a single can of Stella Artois, and that very official Bud Light costs $8 for a single glass \u2013 even more if that glass is a branded souvenir model. And the ATMs within Super Bowl City\u2019s boundaries charge you four bucks to get your hands on your own money. The Super Bowl\u2019s golden anniversary is predicted to bring a million happy fans to festivities in this graceful city. It is expected to cost San Francisco nearly $5m it can barely afford \u2013 none of which the National Football League has plans to pay back. It is exacerbating traffic in two already busy neighborhoods, and the game isn\u2019t even being played here.

They stood in line for 30 minutes. All to pose for photos in front of a massive, gold 50 perched atop the words \u201cSuper Bowl\u201d.\n\u201cYou drive all the way over here, so you\u2019ve got to participate,\u201d said Mary Megarry, a law firm administrative assistant. She was on the prowl for Broncos merchandise, she said, and wanted to share the fellow feeling of football fans just like her. \u201cWe\u2019ve been to Broncos games,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we couldn\u2019t afford this one.\u201d Dolores Quigg, who lives in nearby Belmont, quaffed sauvignon blanc and surveyed the crowds. She was born in 1945, the year before the 49ers arrived in San Francisco and was just happy to spend her day off in Super Bowl City. \u201cHow often does the Super Bowl come to your city?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019m old enough, so it probably won\u2019t happen again in my lifetime.\u201d Behind Quigg and to the left loomed the stage where Chris Isaak, Alicia Keys, OneRepublic and other performers entertained the crowds at free concerts in the week leading up to Super Bowl 50. Levi\u2019s sponsored the stage. Verizon underwrote the so-called fan village. Intel has a pavilion, and so does Hyundai. The Bud Light booth sports a huge statue of a hand gripping a massive football; the installation is made entirely of flattened beer cans. But Domingo and Carol Valderrama didn\u2019t mind Super Bowl City\u2019s wall-to-wall logos. He\u2019s a retired machinist; she\u2019s looking for work. He sported a 49ers shirt; her black outfit honored the Raiders. \u201cWithout the corporate sponsors, this wouldn\u2019t be possible,\u201d Domingo Valderrama said, as he and his wife waited in line for a photo op and sipped a cold one. \u201cIt\u2019s regular Bud,\u201d he said.

The full series can be found here. Privacy As GPS tracking devices for children become ever more affordable, and fingerprint scanners replace ID cards in schools, technology is undeniably changing the shape of privacy for a generation often referred to as \u2018digital natives\u2019. This is no more obvious than on Facebook. Baby pictures once confined to the private pages of family photo albums are now shared publicly. A 2015 study by Internet company Nominet found UK children will feature in around 1,000 online photos before their fifth birthday. What will the impacts be for a new generation whose childhood has played out on the Internet? One reader said they posted one picture of their baby on Facebook before deciding to quit the social media site completely:\nHowever, @ursuppe thinks there\u2019s little harm in putting baby photos online:\nSocial media safety 46% of British parents worry that they don\u2019t know what their children are doing online, according to research (pdf) commissioned for anti-virus software company Norton. With cyerbullying on the rise, reports of drug dealers on Instagram and anonymous app Kik linked to a murder investigation, can children truly be safe online? Social media sites are becoming more active in protecting their users through functions like reporting tools, and technology companies and software providers are building ever more sophisticated parental control packages that limit which corners of the internet children can access. We asked readers if spying on a child\u2019s internet search history was an effective way of keeping them safe. Reader @Mariane Bicho believes \u201csurveillance is never a solution\u201d:\n19-year-old @Mike Beskine agrees:\nChildhood development It\u2019s estimated that three-quarters of UK children now spend less time outside than prison inmates. With broadband added to the Oxford Junior Dictionary, and beech, bluebell and buttercup dropped, there is little doubt that childhood is changing. Low-tech baby monitors are being swapped for hi-tech wearables that monitor a baby\u2019s breathing and heart rate; children\u2019s board games have evolved into smartphone apps; and Barbie now lives in a Wi-Fi enabled house. We asked readers if they felt smart toys were making parents lazy. @kidvidkid thought it was a ridiculous suggestion:\n@Busymom4 advised delaying access to technology for as long as possible while stressing the need for balance:\nUltimately the importance of balance has played out across our whole series on child rights and technology. While it\u2019s true that technology can open young people up to new dangers, Larry Magid, CEO of ConnectSafely.org, reminds us that young people can also use it as a force for good, writing in his December op-ed: While social media has been linked with the radicalisation of some teens, young people are able to use online platforms to connect with each other, promoting understanding rather than violence and extremism. Nobel prize winning youth activist, Malala Yousafzai, for example, has advised social media is the easy place to start taking action against injustice.\n",

The former deputy prime minister highlighted a \u201cgreat congregation of concern\u201d across the political spectrum after Theresa May published the draft investigatory powers bill. It would allow the security agencies to access the internet browsing histories of UK citizens for up to 12 months and establish a new legal framework for tracking web and phone use.\nClegg told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4: \u201cVery few other countries other than Russia take this dragnet approach.\u201d He spoke out as the draft investigatory powers bill joint committee, made up of peers and MPs, published a critical report on the bill. And parliament\u2019s intelligence and security committee (ISC) warned earlier this week that the draft bill failed to account for all the intrusive spying powers of the security agencies. Dominic Grieve, the ISC chairman, said: \u201cIt is ... disappointing that the draft bill does not cover all the agencies\u2019 intrusive capabilities \u2013 as the committee recommended last year. This means that the various powers and authorisations remain scattered throughout different pieces of legislation and, as a result, the draft bill is limited in the extent to which it can provide a comprehensive legal framework. In our view it is a missed opportunity.\u201d Clegg, who forced the Tories to abandon an earlier version of the snooper\u2019s charter as deputy prime minister in 2012, highlighted the concerns over the new draft bill.\nHe said: \u201cWhy there is this great congregation of concern from all wings of political opinion is because what the home office is in essence proposing is that in order to be able to surveil and analyse something they are saying they want to collect everything on everyone. That is a dragnet approach which I have always felt is disproportionate.\u201d He dismissed the analogy of the needle in the haystack \u2013 the argument that the security agencies need to embark on the bulk collection of data in order to be able to find crucial nuggets of details about terrorists. He told Today: \u201cI know the needle-haystack argument and it is a comforting analogy. But the reality is a little different. Why, for instance, is there no other European or Commonwealth country that I know that pursues this dragnet approach?\n\u201cThe Americans and the Canadians, according to the independent reviewer of anti-terrorism legislation David Anderson, told him there are constitutional constraints on them pursuing this dragnet approach. The Australians have a prohibition on it. The Danes interestingly had a very similar power for some years and then scrapped it a couple of years ago because they discovered, unsurprisingly, that the police were drowning in huge amounts of useless information. \u201cThe Home Office in Britain, almost uniquely in the developed world, has been peddling this idea for about eight years now that you need to create a vast bucket of information about everybody\u2019s interaction on the internet every second of the day. \u201cSo the question is about proportionality. Is it proportionate in a small \u2018l\u2019 liberal, small \u2018d\u2019 democracy to retain information on everything \u2013 from the music you download on Spotify, to the app you opened, to the supermarket website that you visit \u2013 in order to go after the bad guys? Very few other countries other than Russia take this dragnet approach.\u201d\n",

        "body": "Parliament is about to embark on the long process of producing new legislation that will replace the discredited Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa). It will address the needs for law enforcement agencies to identify and track murderers, paedophiles, criminals and terrorists across the rapidly expanding digital communications arena. We should rejoice, as it is an opportunity for our country to set a global gold standard of legislation to keep our people safe and yet take due account of individual privacy. Far from welcoming this opportunity, I have noticed a barrage of misguided and vitriolic comment often painting our police and agencies as a risk to freedom and heaping praise on Edward Snowden (May\u2019s new surveillance powers face opposition, 5 November). We should be clear that the men and women in the agencies and police work tirelessly to ensure our greatest freedom, that of life itself. Snowden has, by releasing masses of classified material, made it inevitable that innocents will die who would otherwise have lived. This legislation is critical for the security of our people, so let\u2019s stop using rabble-rousing, meaningless phrases and work to ensure it is fit for purpose when it becomes an act in 12 months time. Alan West House of Lords \u00a0 \u2022 Yet another victory for terrorism conceded by the home secretary (Mass-snooping has been going on for years, November 5). With every such erosion of liberty and privacy, the society the government purports to be protecting is diminished. Even if it is possible to trust today\u2019s government ministers, one cannot trust the next government, or the one after that, which will have access to this huge database. Governments continually seek to answer questions of the how and the where of terrorism but, it appears, never the far more important question: \u201cWhy do they do it?\u201d Prevention is crucial and the actions of western governments towards the Palestinians, in Iraq and Libya, and, probably, in due course in Syria, feed seductive extremist voices and assist their recruitment efforts. A change of emphasis is urgently required. Michael Meadowcroft Leeds \u2022 For \u201cPeter\u201d to say he wants the \u201cdebate to be informed by the facts\u201d (GCHQ needs to collect bulk data to do its work, 5 November) is disingenuous in that without Edward Snowden there would be no facts or debate. All we ever have are half-understood inferences. We use these to judge the trustworthiness of governments. We know that there are secret courts with Kafkaesque proceedings. We know that peaceful protest organisations are frequently penetrated by the security services. We know that users of certain software are targeted by the security services, not for wrongdoing but assumed guilt. Bulk data access is to be granted by a blindfold judge. From experience we know that these powers will be misused and that the only thing worse than a state that knows everything about its citizens is one that thinks it knows everything.\nThe statement that \u201cGCHQ is not reading the emails of everyone in the UK\u201d probably means that something is \u2013 something that can read thousands of documents per second, possibly making decisions about whose bulk data needs hoovering up. Even if this is not happening, the assumption that technology somehow stops developing here is naive. We can give Peter the benefit of the doubt about his good intentions, but not about the road that they are paving. Kevin Bell Manchester \u2022 The day after home secretary Theresa May admitted in parliament to the bulk collection of telephone and email records in Britain for over a decade, Peter, \u201ca senior GCHQ officer\u201d, informs us that the parliamentary intelligence and security committee stated \u201cthe agencies ... do not have the legal authority, the resources, the technical capability, or the desire to intercept the communications of British citizens\u201d. Wrong on all counts, it appears. Peter then quotes senior judge Anthony Mayer saying \u201cemphatically no\u201d when asked about GCHQ mass intrusion into the private affairs of innocent citizens following his (Mayer\u2019s) investigation. Either all these folk (and Peter) were kept in the dark, like poor old Nick Clegg (Opinion, 6 November), or they are all liars. Little wonder many mistrust even the latest version of May\u2019s snooper\u2019s charter. Nick White Bishop\u2019s Stortford, Hertfordshire \u2022 It is just over 15 months since leading members of the coalition government were strong-armed by the security services into retrospectively authorising their access to phone and email records. Obediently, they railroaded the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014 through parliament in three days. I am surprised at the way this seems to have been forgotten. Now, inevitably, they want more. Surveillance and control are instinctive to officialdom and they will always have arguments for why they should have more.

        "body": "One of the broadest pushes to reel in America\u2019s surveillance state isn\u2019t in Congress, the White House or a courtroom; arguably it\u2019s in Joe Simitian\u2019s office in California\u2019s Santa Clara County government building. Simitian \u2013 63 and bespectacled - is a supervisor on the county board here. This winter he drafted a proposal for regulation that would require local law enforcement to justify each time they use any piece of surveillance technology \u2013 fake cellphone towers, computer hacks, license plate readers, GPS trackers, or anything else that helps cops track civilians. The police aren\u2019t his biggest fans. Simitian has spent the past year trying to slow the sheriff\u2019s purchase of new gadgets, and describes the relationship as having a \u201chealthy tension\u201d. \u201cI am perpetually the guy at our board meetings saying, \u2018I just want to be mindful of \u2026\u2019\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cPeople talk about the importance of constitutional rights, but somehow this one just seems to have taken a back seat to others.\u201d Privacy advocates say the Santa Clara regulation would be one of the broadest anti-surveillance measures being considered anywhere in the US. As Washington remains deadlocked over how to put a leash on an ever-growing list of surveillance technology used by state and local police departments, it will probably be up to city councils and county boards to play watchdog. That can be a daunting task for local politicians who often have little technical experience and are more focused on dangerous intersections and village planning. Based in Silicon Valley, Simitian might be a special case. He\u2019s been close to technology since his mother helped program computers with punched cards. At one point she worked at North American Aerospace Defense Command in Colorado Springs. He also has an interest in non-parochial issues. The bookshelf in his office includes treatises on recent foreign conflicts \u2013 With The Contras \u2013 and most of the autobiographies to come out of the Bush and Obama administrations. If privacy is a passion, he doesn\u2019t show it verbally. In conversation and at board meetings he speaks in a steady, even cadence. He\u2019s also prone to unprompted anecdotes. Like this one: just before he joined the state assembly in 2000, an employee at the local Microsoft campus asked him for his thoughts on privacy legislation. Simitian said his first response was that he thought that was something handled by Washington DC. The room laughed. Since then, his policy efforts have donned a tin foil hat. In 2001, he introduced what would become the first data breach disclosure law in the US where if hackers steal a company\u2019s data, the firm has to notify affected consumers. Since then, 46 states have followed suit. Google was affected by his 2003 law that requires companies that collect personal data to clearly post a privacy policy. And thanks to him, California in 2008 became one of four states to outlaw the mandatory implantation of a radio frequency identity chip under someone\u2019s skin. As he paged over a binder of county documents and news clippings related to privacy, Simitian acknowledged, \u201cthese issues seem a little abstract when you\u2019re in the middle of a recession\u201d.\nBut he said that someone has to remain on guard. If the electorate waits to care about privacy only after it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s probably too late, he said. \u201cThis is not something that happens overnight,\u201d Simitian said. \u201cThis is a steady drip of the erosion of the right to privacy.\u201d His efforts come as Congress and states have moved to regulate specific electronic surveillance methods, such as aerial drones, bulk telephone record collection, and devices that impersonate a cell tower to intercept calls. But making laws takes a lot of time, and as new bits of spy kit continuously show up it can be hard to keep pace. So Simitian\u2019s draft ordinance would require the local sheriff or any county agency to get board approval if it wants to buy any new piece of surveillance technology or use an existing system in a new way. This applies to any \u201ctechnological tool used, designed or primarily intended to collect \u2026 information specifically associated with, or capable of being associated with, any individual or group\u201d. The sheriff would then have to provide details for a public report that would explain what the technology is and how it would be used. In Silicon Valley speak, the statute is, theoretically, future-proof. Law enforcement also says it is overly burdensome. \u201cWe want to be careful about tying the hands of police officers who are just trying to solve crimes and protect people,\u201d said the Santa Clara County district attorney, Jeffrey Rosen. \u201cIt\u2019s not as though we\u2019re in a country where there are no laws about how law enforcement is supposed to act.\u201d Rosen said he has one-on-one chats with Simitian at least once a month. And he said he genuinely respects him, even if he disagrees. He did, however, note that when he talks with law enforcement counterparts in other cities, they don\u2019t seem to have to debate with a Simitian. In an interview, the district attorney described the county supervisor as \u201cunique\u201d. Even in Santa Clara he can be an anomaly. At a county board meeting last month, Simitian peppered sheriff\u2019s department officials about their request to buy four GPS tracking devices for $3,000 \u2013 a small request given the county\u2019s annual budget, and one that was eventually approved. But Simitian had wanted to know what controls would be placed on who had access to data collected by the trackers. The department, which didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment, recently had several correctional officers accused of inappropriately accessing a database with inmate data. Simitian asked if the sheriff\u2019s department would accept data security advice from a county technology staffer. The sheriff\u2019s department declined. \u201cCaptain, we\u2019ve got legal liability as a county for any misuse or abuse of the system,\u201d Simitian told the board. \u201cI\u2019m just baffled there isn\u2019t some way you\u2019d be open to stepping up the security of the system.\u201d\n",

The proposal was made at a conference in Washington by the director general of cyber at GCHQ, Ciaran Martin, who is also head of the National Cyber Security Centre, which is part of GCHQ. Asking GCHQ for protection carries risks, given its ability to hack into the private details of companies, but some companies and customers might be tempted by the trade-off in terms of proposed security against hackers. Its prime aim is to protect government sites and industries regarded as central to national security but it is offering to widen the scope to include major private companies. Martin\u2019s proposal is only in its infancy. It would raise privacy concerns from customers about major companies opting to place themselves within the GCHQ corral. Martin told the Billington cybersecurity conference that the number of cyber security incidents \u2013 about 200 a month are detected \u2013 was growing and was double the level a year ago. Martin said the UK was vulnerable and a \u201cflagship project\u201d was being explored to protect against customers coming into contact with known malware and bad addresses.

        "body": "David Anderson, QC, the UK\u2019s independent reviewer of terror laws, rightly called his report on what powers the spooks should have and how they should be made more accountable, A Question of Trust. He describes the existing laws covering the interception of communications as \u201cundemocratic, unnecessary and \u2013 in the long run \u2013 intolerable\u201d. He says warrants for targeted interceptions should be approved by judges, not, as now, by ministers, though big questions remain (see below). Anderson\u2019s report was published last Thursday. It was not long before elements of the security establishment - the securocracy - struck back. Three days after Anderson published his 373-page analysis of what is wrong with the way the spooks are allowed to monitor and store private communications, the Sunday Times quoted anonymous sources claiming Russia and China had broken into a secret cache of files top secret files taken by the whistleblower Ed Snowden. As a result, MI6 had been forces to pull agents out of live operations, a claim the BBC repeated. It is far from clear how MI6 agents, or their operations, had been compromised, or even how or indeed whether Moscow and Beijing had got hold of the information. With no trace of irony, Downing Street said it did not comment on leaks. In contrast to what is likely to be increasingly shrill public arguments about the threat from terrorists and the weapons the security and intelligence agencies must be given to cope with it, a sober debate took place at Ditchley Park, a country house not far from Oxford where members of the establishment and their guests discuss important issues of the day. A report on a recent conference on \u201cIntelligence, security and privacy\u201d chaired by Sir John Scarlett, head of MI6 in the runup to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and attended by Robert Hannigan, the new director of GCHQ, was published on Friday on the Ditchley website. \u201cThe reaction of the governments most concerned after the Snowden revelations had often appeared as ducking and weaving, trying to reveal as little as possible, or attempting to change the subject, rather than getting ahead of the argument\u201d, the report of the conference drawn up by the Ditchley director, Sir John Holmes, a former ambassador to the UN and France, notes in a clear reference to the UK and US. \u201cThis had only made things worse and increased public suspicions\u201d, Holmes adds. He continues: \u201cThere was a strong view that oversight could no longer be confined to the collection of intelligence and data. It now had to extend to how these were used...\u201d Though Anderson, in his report, said a new judicial body, the Independent Surveillance and Intelligence Commission, should be responsible for individual targeted intercept warrants, he also said that \u201cis not intended to replace the existing...powers for law enforcement agencies to obtain large volumes of data directly from communication service providers for cell-site analysis when it is necessary and proportionate to do so, for example when searching for or tracking the movements of a suspect.\u201d Anderson thus in effect paved the way for the introduction of the \u201csnooper\u2019s charter\u201d that the spooks and the home secretary, Theresa May, are so keen to set up \u2013 the unwarranted bulk collection of personal communications data that tracks everyone\u2019s use of their phones, the web, and social media. These are the issues on which the government must be confronted. On what terms, should private companies give personal data to government agencies? How will the security and intelligence agencies be prevented from hacking the data, secretly breaking into encrypted communications? According to those attending the Ditchley conference, \u201ccompanies were willing to give access to their data, but this could only be through the front door, on the basis of properly authorised, legally sound and specific warrants, not through the back door.\u201d But in what circumstances will the companies agree not to tell customers suspected of criminal intent that the spooks want information held on them? Meanwhile, Anderson suggests capabilities, though not operations, should be revealed - something GCHQ in particular has strongly objected to. And how will the bulk data collection be scrutinised properly so that it does not become mass surveillance, something the spooks insist they do not indulge in? In the end, the use to which data intercepted by computers is used by humans is determined by the employees of GCHQ, MI5, and MI6.\n",

        "body": "The Investigatory Powers Tribunal is behaving more and more like a real court. It rightly refused what was seen as a pretty desperate plea by GCHQ at a hearing last month not to undermine the intelligence services\u2019 cherished \u201cneither-confirm-nor-deny\u201d (NCND) policy. But the IPT also took care to preserve national security by not allowing suspected terrorists to find out whether they are under surveillance \u2013 the eavesdropping centre\u2019s nightmare scenario, as I described it last month. The case concerned legally privileged material: exchanges between lawyers and their clients relating to legal advice. In February, MI5, MI6 and GCHQ conceded that their regime for intercepting such material was unlawful because it did not meet human rights standards. The concession was made in connection with compensation claims brought against the government by two former Libyan dissidents, Abdel Hakim Belhaj and Sami al Saadi, together with their respective families \u2013 eight individuals in all. So the next question for the IPT was a factual one: had the claimants\u2019 legally privileged communications in fact been intercepted? The tribunal never tells a claimant whether he or she has been the subject of lawful interception. A finding of \u201cno determination\u201d means either that there was no interception or that any interception was lawful. The IPT made no determination in favour of seven of the individual claimants. But it did make a determination in favour of Saadi.\nThe tribunal told Saadi that GCHQ held two documents containing material in which he owned legal professional privilege. However, the documents \u201cdid not disclose nor refer to any legal advice\u201d. Moreover, the privileged information had not been not used by the intelligence services or the government in connection with Saadi\u2019s claim that he had been abducted with the help of MI6 and secretly flown to Tripoli, to be tortured by Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s security police. That claim was settled in 2012, when the government paid Saadi and his family compensation of \u00a32.2m without admitting liability. Belhaj\u2019s claim continues. Even if the legally privileged information had been disclosed to the government it would not have been any help to the defence, the IPT added. No compensation was awarded by the IPT because no harm had been done. However, in a symbolic move that calls to mind the Guardian\u2019s enforced destruction of computers containing documents leaked by the NSA-whistleblower Edward Snowden, GCHQ was required to delete or destroy the parts of the documents they held containing privileged information. Crucially, though, the IPT refused to order GCHQ to hand the documents over to Saadi. That might have helped him find out how his information had been intercepted. More to the point, it might \u201cenable a person who is legitimately subject to surveillance or interception to take measures to make such surveillance or interception more difficult to achieve in the future\u201d. In its written judgment, the court recalled that it had been asked by James Eadie QC, counsel for the intelligence services, to declare that \u201cno determination\u201d could cover unlawful interception \u2013 and not merely, as now, lawful interception or no interception. \u201cThat level of ambiguity would place the validity of all the decisions of this tribunal in doubt,\u201d the tribunal declared. In its judgment, delivered by Mr Justice Burton and four other members, the IPT said: The tribunal has been entrusted with the task of investigating complaints, to a large extent in closed proceedings, and without divulging details which might place security at risk. It would, in the tribunal\u2019s judgment, undermine public confidence that parliament had created a means of holding the relevant public agencies to account if the tribunal\u2019s findings of unlawful conduct by the intelligence agencies could be concealed on the basis of a non-specific submission of a risk to public safety.\nThe IPT explained that, in cases where disclosure could have very damaging effects on the ability of the intelligence services to protect the public, the NCND policy justified limiting the information that would be disclosed. But if a determination by the IPT \u201cdiscloses that there has been interference with a complainant\u2019s [human] rights, that is a consequence of such contravention, and in our judgment cannot be avoided\u201d. The government published new draft codes of conduct for consultation in February. These provide increased safeguards that apply when the intelligence agencies are handling legally privileged or journalistic material. The consultation period closed a few days before parliament was dissolved but, as the IPT noted in its judgment, a final version of the new code has not yet been put before parliament. GCHQ are likely to be relieved that the IPT found there had been no use of privileged information in respect of Belhaj or Saadi. But Richard Stein of Leigh Day, the solicitor who represented the claimants and their families, together with lawyers from the campaign group Reprieve, said he was sure that the unlawful behaviour that that had been uncovered in this case was merely the tip of the iceberg. \u201cAll lawyers and their clients dealing with cases involving MI5, MI6 and GCHQ should consider whether to lodge a complaint in the tribunal to protect their privileged communications,\u201d Stein added.\n",

Shami Chakrabati, the director of Liberty, and Heather Brooke, the journalist who exposed the MPs\u2019 expenses scandal, believe the bill - drawn up largely to combat terrorism - will give the state \u201ca blank cheque\u201d to spy on citizens and also presents a very real threat to investigative journalism. Chakrabati and Brooke were taking part in an event, Press freedom in a surveillance state, organised by the London Press Club and the Society of Editors at London\u2019s Stationers\u2019 Hall. According to Chakrabati - once dubbed by the Sun as \u201cthe most dangerous woman in Britain\u201d - if the investigatory powers bill is enacted it will \u201cturn all of us into suspects.\u201d She called for \u201can appropriate balance between liberty and security. But since 9/11 to be somebody even calling for a more proportionate approach is to be a traitor.\u201d She praised Edward Snowden for his revelations, saying: \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be capable of having this debate but for his intervention.\u201d Challenged on the need for surveillance as protection from terrorism, she said that while the police always had the power search homes and tap phones, what we face \u201cwithout public debate or knowledge or consent or with parliamentary involvement, let alone the involvement of the judiciary\u201d is \u201cblanket surveillance.\u201d And this surveillance is not about the targeting of those who have aroused suspicion \u201cbut something which would turn all of us into suspects.\u201d She implored journalists to oppose it. She said: \u201cIf everyone is suspect and all communications are to be captured and retained, looked at or not, how do you protect journalists\u2019 sources, how do you protect parliamentarians, how do you medical confidentiality or legal confidentiality? You can\u2019t.\u201d Brooke also warned against a \u201cno privacy for us, no scrutiny of them\u201d attitude, especially in view of the government\u2019s current attempts to curtail freedom of information requests. Now a professor at City University London, she served on the Independent Surveillance Review Panel alongside the former MI6 chief, John Scarlett (who argued in the Times on Monday that our way of life depends \u201cmore than ever\u201d on \u201ceffective intelligence work\u201d). Brooke said: \u201cIt\u2019s not that if you have nothing to fear, you have nothing to hide. But if you are doing certain types of journalism, by definition you are pissing off powerful people \u2013 people with money and power \u2013 and you might be considered subversive to the state. \u201cFor example, the stuff that\u2019s been exposed about the police (infiltrating pressure groups) you are challenging the police, they don\u2019t like it so, under their Ripa powers, they have made life difficult for journalists. And that\u2019s the problem. \u201cWhen you give to the state this gigantic storehouse of all of your internet and telecommunications data, the minute you come on their radar as a person of interest, they have a litmus test maybe not to arrest you, but maybe to blackmail you, to put pressure on you, to do things than may stop you doing certain stories and may curtail your investigation.\u201d Fellow panellist Martin Bentham, the London Evening Standard\u2019s home affairs editor, was less pessimistic. He believe Chakrabati and Brooke had \u201cvalid arguments... about the need for proper safeguards and proper monitoring\u201d but did not \u201caccept we are going to be living in some sort of East German state with everybody under surveillance.\u201d What had emerged post-Snowden, he said, was the extent of activities by the security services that even the regulators were unaware of, and in particular how journalists sources could be compromised. \u201cThe question now is whether the new investigatory powers proposals will provide proper safeguards, and I am relatively optimistic that with judicial oversight, for example, on warrants on journalists, we will achieve something.\u201d *As chair of the debate, I did not take notes, so this report - published on the London Press Club website - comes courtesy of Paul Charman, for which I am grateful.\n",

        "body": "Microsoft and Google, two of the world\u2019s greatest monopolies, have been bitter rivals for nearly 20 years. But suddenly, in late April, they announced a startling accord. The companies have withdrawn all regulatory complaints against one another, globally. Rather than fighting their battles in public courts and commissions, they have agreed to privately negotiate. This is a gentleman\u2019s agreement. The specifics are secret, but the message on both sides is that the deal reflects a change in management philosophy. Microsoft\u2019s new chief, Satya Nadella, is eager to push the vision of a dynamic, collaborative Microsoft, partnering with everyone from Apple to Salesforce. The most dramatic of these partners is Google, a company that has long been considered Microsoft\u2019s great arch-rival. The wind started to change in September, just after Sundar Pichai became Google\u2019s chief executive, when the two companies agreed to stop feuding over patents \u2013 a first step toward the current agreement. The common corporate line is that the companies want to compete on products, not court cases.\nBut this public relations gambit masks two far more interesting tales. One is about Microsoft and its desperate chase for relevance. The other is about Google, money and power. Both are part of a broader, deeply worrying narrative \u2013 a story about how tech companies are busy redrawing the lines around our lives, and facing little resistance in doing so. Waste and fury Nobody ever wants to start a legal fight. Fractious, painful and wasteful, they divert huge resources, often for little productive gain. But this in itself fails to explain Microsoft\u2019s decision to drop pending regulatory complaints against Google in Europe, Brazil and Argentina, as well as to cease funding and participating in lobby groups that it has backed for eight years, such as FairSearch.org and ICOMP, the Initiative for a Competitive Online Marketplace. So what does explain it? It could be seen as a pragmatic move. Microsoft\u2019s profits still exceed Google\u2019s, but the ratio has been in decline for a decade. Meanwhile, since 2012, Apple has outstripped both companies combined (even if recent figures suggest this momentum might be slowing). A suite of regulatory enquiries into Google\u2019s alleged abuses of its monopoly will continue even in Microsoft\u2019s absence \u2013 both in places where Microsoft has filed complaints (Europe, Brazil, Argentina) and in others where it hasn\u2019t, such as India. With Microsoft\u2019s withdrawal, it is clear that the remaining complainants in these fights \u2013 generally small, niche internet businesses \u2013 are legitimate critics in their own right. But then again, it takes serious coordination and resources to sustain and succeed in antitrust fights. Winning, especially in a broad and generally impactful manner, is a much taller order without a deep-pocketed supporter such as Microsoft. New Microsoft But there\u2019s another possible, rather more cunning, motive. Microsoft today is facing a very different business ecosystem to the one it dominated in the 1990s. It needs to adapt. And it appears to want to do so by positioning itself at the heart of what Satya Nadella describes as \u201csystems of intelligence\u201d.\nExplaining this concept at Hannover Messe 2016, Nadella defined systems of intelligence as cloud-enabled digital feedback loops. They rely on the continuous flow of data from people, places and things, connected to a web of activity. And they promise unprecedented power to reason, predict and gain insight. This is unbridled Big Data utopianism. And it is a vision that brings Microsoft squarely into Google territory. So maybe Microsoft is pulling out of regulatory battles because it doesn\u2019t want to shoot itself in the foot. For emeritus Harvard Business School professor Shoshana Zuboff, this gets to the core of the Google-Microsoft deal.\nZuboff is a leading critic of what she calls \u201csurveillance capitalism\u201d, the monetization of free behavioral data acquired through surveillance and sold on to entities with an interest in your future behavior. As she explained to the Guardian: \u201cGoogle discovered surveillance capitalism. Microsoft has been late to this game, but it has now waded in. Viewed in this way, its agreement with Google is predictable and rational.\u201d And here the most sinister upshot of Microsoft\u2019s decision to stop needling Google with legal disputes becomes clear. \u201cA key theme I write about is that surveillance capitalism has thrived in lawless space,\u201d says Zuboff. \u201cRegulations and laws are its enemy. Democratic oversight is a threat. Lawlessness is so vital to the surveillance capitalism project,\u201d she continues, \u201cthat Google and Microsoft\u2019s shared interest in freedom from regulation outweighs any narrower competitive interests they might have or once thought they had. They can\u2019t insist to the public that they must remain unregulated, while trying to impose regulations on one another.\u201d Standing up to power What does all this mean for the cases pending against Google? For Maurice Stucke and Allen Grunes, American antitrust experts and co-authors of a comprehensive new book examining the deep and reaching implications of platform and data monopolies, Zuboff\u2019s warning of a lawless alliance among tech giants such as Microsoft and Google only accentuates the demand for rigorous, intellectually led regulatory action. And when it comes to Google, the case for action is in their view clear.\n\u201cThe one thing that any antitrust regime absolutely has to do, if it is to be effective, is to stand up to the most powerful companies of the time,\u201d explains Grunes. \u201cTake that away and antitrust ceases to be meaningful. \u201cThe antitrust authorities in the US and EU did that in the case of Microsoft. It required brains, resources and relentless pursuit and commitment.\u201d Yet only the Europeans, he argues, seem to have the intellectual leadership to be doing it in the case of Google. \u201cThe failure of the FTC to take meaningful action against Google is without question one of the great failures of all time.\u201d Microsoft and Google\u2019s new deal to stop fighting each other is an interesting, strategic corporate move. But it is a move accompanied by a much stronger, deeper play: to collect and capitalize data \u2013 including data about us, our behaviors, and our interactions. The challenge for regulators and citizens is complex but essential \u2013 and has only just begun.\n",

He always thought widespread acceptance of their fingerprint scanners would be for convenience, not surveillance, but he\u2019s not so sure any more. \u201cWe\u2019ve been around since 1988, and this year we\u2019re hot, very hot,\u201d said Jeff Brown, the vice-president of sales at optical sensor company SecuGen. \u201cEverything has two sides to it \u2013 a butter knife is a weapon. I don\u2019t like seeing it as a weapon but you can make it into that. And that\u2019s what\u2019s happening.\u201d The personal security department at CES, once a quiet, overlooked corner of the flashy gadget show, was packed and frenzied this year. Its popularity stirred an internal reckoning for the security gadget makers who are now central to the conversation about privacy and politics. Some longtime sellers like Brown are worried about their new buyers. Others, who said until this year they were always called paranoid, are amazed and delighted how mainstream the interest has become. It\u2019s become an arms race as tracking hardware like the handheld Stingray, which intercepts texts, gets cheaper and better, while people flock to privacy apps and anti-surveillance electronics bags.\n\u201cAt the end of 2015, suddenly there\u2019s a much greater acceptance of biometrics. Sadly, sadly,\u201d said Brown, who sells his fingerprint scanners largely to governments but worries about a dystopian future where corporations and governments always know people\u2019s locations.\n\u201cWith the Russian jet, Paris and San Bernardino, people all of a sudden are saying, \u2018OK, what are we gonna need to do to stay secure. I\u2019m willing to do things I wasn\u2019t last year.\u2019\u201d Across the aisle, Randy Zar and his son run Silent Pocket, which makes attractive leather iPhone and laptop faraday cages of copper and zinc alloy to block electric fields, shielding electronics. \u201cWhen we first opened, it was mostly the paranoid sort of people. People thought I was crazy. People thought I was paranoid. Now they don\u2019t,\u201d Zar said, gesturing at the curious crowd around his station. \u201cNow it\u2019s more the everyday people here.\u201d Government officials are getting interested too, though, Zar said. An official was actually meeting with his son at that very moment, he said, pointing her out. She\u2019s wearing a suit and tells me she\u2019s part of the Turkish department of commerce. \u201cI just want to get information,\u201d she tells me, before putting her hand over her name badge. But not everyone in the security aisle was conflicted about their popularity. In the same densely packed corridor as the privacy gadgets is something quite opposite: a group called The Findables Company who make trackers.\nCheap, small trackers have so far only operated with bluetooth and stop responding if they\u2019re more than a couple of hundred feet away. But the next generation of small, attachable trackers, coming out this year for $69.99, will have true GPS abilities, able to report on a location anywhere with cell service. \u201cOur normal tracker works where the item tracking is keys, backpacks. It doesn\u2019t help with pets, kids, things that can move on their own. GPS is great for things that can walk,\u201d said sales representative Nick Trouw. Is he worried about people tracking their wives or exes? \u201cNot at all. You can already do that. If you\u2019ve got a phone and I\u2019ve had access to it. Or if you have Chrome with location services turned on, I can already track you,\u201d he said. \u201cThe privacy boat? That ship\u2019s sailed.\u201d\n",

        "body": "Two months after Donald Trump became US president, it can be tempting to treat some of his political habits and tactics as a new normal that is somehow not worth responding to. It is a temptation that must be resisted, especially by those who are concerned to uphold politics in a civil and plural public space, and to maintain alliances that are intended to keep the world safe. Mr Trump\u2019s allegation that Barack Obama was a \u201cbad (or sick) guy\u201d who ordered the \u201cwire tapping\u201d of his New York offices during the presidential election campaign was made two weeks ago. Since then, no evidence whatever has been found to support the claims. On the contrary, all the known facts undermine them. By normal standards, Mr Trump seems to have committed a wholly unsupported calumny against Mr Obama and the institution of the presidency. The consensus has now hardened. This week the senate intelligence committee chair, a Republican, said he had seen \u201cno indications\u201d that Trump Tower had been an object of surveillance. His opposite number in the house of representatives, also a Republican, said \u201cclearly the president was wrong\u201d about the charge against Mr Obama. House speaker Paul Ryan added his voice: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen no evidence of that,\u201d he said. At that point Mr Trump should have apologised. His allegations were shocking, even by the standards of his many apparently off-the-cuff tweets. Most important of all, they were wrong. This week, though, just when it looked as if political Washington had succeeded in wiping away the president\u2019s mess without undue publicity, Mr Trump\u2019s White House shot from the hip once again. His spokesman Sean Spicer responded to the congressional statements by repeating a Fox News allegation that Mr Obama \u201ccould very easily have and probably did use\u201d Britain\u2019s GCHQ to get round the US chain of command and bug Mr Trump for him. This is an incredibly serious allegation. If true, it would mean that Mr Obama and GCHQ had colluded in a deliberate breach of a five-power intelligence agreement not to spy on allies. This instantly undid all the attempts to heal the wounds caused by concerns over Russia\u2019s links with the Trump team. GCHQ\u2019s dismissal of Mr Spicer\u2019s innuendo was total and was clearly made on Theresa May\u2019s authority. In an unprecedented break with its normal refusal ever to comment, GCHQ said that the White House claims were nonsense, utterly ridiculous and should be ignored. In the context of the British governing class\u2019s long obsession with being America\u2019s most obedient ally, this was truly extraordinary. On Friday the White House backed down but Mr Trump, focused on his loyal rightwing base as usual, revoiced his original suspicions in his press conference with Angela Merkel. This was all as clear a sign as could be that Mr Trump is not a new normal but a new abnormal. What does it now mean to be America\u2019s ally if the US president makes things up and then repeats them more recklessly? Mrs Merkel was the latest to face this lurching dilemma as Mr Trump refused to shake hands at a photo call on Friday. Mrs Merkel has been careful in her dealings with the Trump administration for good reason. Mrs May has not been so wise. From the start she has pretended Mr Trump embodies a continuity he does not. In her speech in Cardiff on Friday Mrs May repeated her lines about a more internationalist Britain emerging from Brexit. But an internationalist needs allies. She spurns good ones in Europe while trusting an unreliable one in Washington. Mr Trump doesn\u2019t do alliances. If Mrs May is not careful she will get known as someone who doesn\u2019t do them either.\n",

It is promising to shift the regulator to a \u201cuser-pays\u201d funding model \u2013 in which the institutions it regulates are forced to pay for the ongoing cost of their regulation \u2013 so taxpayers no longer have to fund its operations. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, said the reform package was a considered response to the problems plaguing the financial services industry. He said it was better than the proposal from the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, who has been calling for a royal commission following years of financial scandals inside Australia\u2019s banks. \u201cThe motive of Bill Shorten is clear here,\u201d Morrison said on Wednesday. \u201cHis focus is not about getting outcomes for people affected by what\u2019s happening in the banking and financial industry, his motive is about getting a political outcome for one person \u2013 Bill Shorten.\u201d In all, the Turnbull government\u2019s reform package will be worth $127.2m over four years, with $121m of that being funded by Australia\u2019s banks, and the remaining $6m hitting the budget bottom line. More than $61m will be used to boost the regulator\u2019s data analytics and surveillance abilities, while $57m will enable better, ongoing surveillance in the areas of the financial advice, responsible lending, life insurance and breach reporting.\nThe user-pays model will begin operation at the start of the 2017-18 financial year, but little detail has been provided by the government to explain how it will work. Morrison said if the regulator required any extra money in the future, it could claim more money from Australia\u2019s banks. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole point of this transition,\u201d he said. \u201cThis puts [the regulator] on a much more sustainable footing.\u201d He also said he would be \u201cfurious\u201d if the banks passed the cost of any user-pays levy onto consumers, but he gave no guarantee that the banks would not do so. The government\u2019s reform package means the financial regulator \u2013 the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) \u2013 will receive a large boost in technological and financial firepower, going some way to redress the $120m funding it lost in the former Abbott government\u2019s 2014 budget. It means Asic will have greater ability to monitor and prosecute modern financial crimes, something for which it has been criticised for failing to do adequately in recent years. The chairman of Asic, Greg Medcraft, has had his term extended by 18 months so he can oversee the reforms inside his institution. In response to the changes, Medcraft \u2013 who has also been criticised heavily during his time as Asic chief \u2013 said they showed the government had confidence in him. \u201cWe have a lot of important work to continue and I am keen to get on with the job,\u201d he said.\nThe reforms are a response from the government to the capability review into Asic\u2019s performance, which it commissioned in July last year. That review has not been released publicly yet, but it is understood to contain heavy criticism of Asic\u2019s performance in recent years. As part of the regulator\u2019s transformation, the government will remove Asic from the Public Service Act, taking it outside the public service.

        "body": "I was alarmed by John Lanchester's assessment (Inside the Snowden files, 4\u00a0October) of the extent of GCHQ's surveillance operations and the lack of effective legal restrictions on its ambit. Even more worrying was his description of a GCHQ legal briefing on the scope of article 8 of the European convention on human rights. This apparently suggests \"it is legal for the state to breach article 8 'In the interests of national security, public safety or the economic wellbeing of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others'.\" Without any qualification, this advice is breathtakingly Orwellian. Hopefully, the briefing also contains what all human rights lawyers know is a crucial preceding phrase in article 8: \"There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right [to respect for private and family life] except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society.\" The difference between Lanchester's account of GCHQ's legal briefing and article 8's true wording might appear a cosmetic one. Any GCHQ operative would assuredly claim that his surveillance was necessary, despite infringing an individual's article 8 rights. But in the event of a legal challenge from someone using article 8 to complain about state surveillance, GCHQ would have to satisfy the court that the infringement of that individual's rights was justified as legal and necessary in a democratic society. The judiciary is not a pushover \u2013 so this just might be difficult. Jane Fortin Emeritus professor of law, University\u00a0of\u00a0Sussex \u2022 I hope the GCHQ briefing John Lanchester refers to does not use his terminology. The convention does not speak of a \"breach\" of article 8, it explains when an \"interference\" with the rights under article 8 is allowed (the French text is similar). The rights, as one would expect, are not absolute but qualified. This is a standard technique in the convention, and the starting point for the approach of the Strasbourg human rights court and British courts in determining whether article 8 has, in fact, been breached in the case before them. David Bentley London \u2022\u2008Perhaps worries about surveillance are low in Britain because people don't feel threatened by government activities here. The secret service has a record of targeting leftwingers, even MPs, but it has not obviously hurt them. So we feel that their knowledge of our present legitimate activities will not be dangerous. However, as Ralph Miliband demonstrated so clearly in his writing, there is something we can characterise as a \"ruling class\". If the rich and powerful were to feel really threatened (perhaps by an attempt to do something serious about the gross inequality in the UK), I have no doubt they would welcome ways of identifying leftwingers, perhaps by their reading material (even the Guardian!) and might be prepared to use illegal means to intern or even kill opponents, as happened in South America. Then we would really have cause to regret not stopping such activity now. Martin Wright Sale, Cheshire \u2022 I suspect that most of us have that hopeless feeling that these \"thought police\" don't even believe these flimsy arguments themselves and merely do what they do because they can. We don't even know how these systems operate. Do they trawl for key words to do a rough sorting process? If so, I suppose it's a really good job that every email sent by every person in the land doesn't habitually contain a random string of key words \u2013 sort of the equivalent of the\u00a0\"mass trespass\". Kevin Bell Manchester \u2022 \"The state\" comprises both its laws and its employees. The laws, as John Lanchester shows, do little to stop thousands of British state security employees discovering our bank account details, passwords and online activities. Such access is also available to contractors with the British security services \u2013 similar to the 480,000 contractors in the US. On a modest estimate, 30,000 people can readily get at our personal details. Assuming at least 1% of people are crooks, then, by state fiat, at least 300 crooks can skim our bank accounts or blackmail us. How many such cases have happened? Why have we not heard about any of them? Although \"12 years of terrorism have killed as many people in the UK as eight days [of road accidents]\", one security failure could add many thousands to the terrorist toll. So Lanchester is right that spying by states is needed. But we need urgent public discussion of how to minimise abuse. Abuse includes not only the Big Brother state but the more immediate prospect of Crooked Cousin: mass, virtually undetectable cybercrime masquerading as state security. Michael Lipton Brighton \u2022 Many years ago I was working as a consultant on a housing project in the South Wales valleys; it was a publicly funded scheme and a part of the funding came from the Housing Development Directorate (HDD), part of the Department of the Environment. To research the effectiveness of increasing the insulation of houses under the better insulated housing programme some homes on this project were elected to be better insulated. To monitor the way the houses were used, \u2013 by way of example, the effects of opening a window was opened in one house \u2013 small sensors were put on the walls in each room so differences in usage could be taken account of when energy comparisons were made. These sensors were small plastic devices that looked quite innocuous and yet were linked to the HDD in London. On one occasion I heard that a child had hung a sock on a sensor and a letter was received from the HDD asking for whatever had been placed on the sensor to be removed as this was affecting its performance.

PUZZLE ONE \u2013 THE \u2018SHADING\u2019 GRID All the initial page reveals is that the grid, which lists strings of numbers alongside, is a \u201cshading puzzle\u201d, with each square on the grid either black or white. \u201cComplete the grid carefully with a black pen and check your answer is complete and correct before proceeding,\u201d it advises.\nBut what happens next? Those hoping to chew over the puzzle alongside their turkey are advised to look away now to avoid potential spoilers. According to players on the Reddit thread \u2013 who also credit commenters under the Guardian story about the puzzle for unlocking one key sequence \u2013 the correct solution to part one reveals a QR code, a type of barcode which, when scanned by a smartphone, will take puzzlers to the next stage. PUZZLE TWO \u2013 SEQUENCING Part two requires players to solve a number of questions about sequences, asking, for instance, for the odd one out among the following list: MATURE, LOVE, WILDE, BUCKET, BECKHAM and SHAKA. As one commenter notes on the Reddit thread: \u201cI enjoyed part 2 so much I don\u2019t want to ruin it for anyone.\u201d\nSimilarly baffling questions in the second stage ask challengers to correctly identify the next letter in the sequence D, D, P, V, C, C, D, and predict what three-letter hashtag follows this garbled semaphore message: ZGJJQ EZRXM. Solving there and other questions unlocks part three, a cryptic round accessed via a URL revealed via the correct answers. PUZZLE THREE \u2013 CRYPTIC CLUES In the third round the answer to each of the four questions is a single word, which collectively form a URL leading to the fourth set of challenges. A sample question: \u201cSamuel says: if agony is the opposite of denial, and witty is the opposite of tepid, then what is the opposite of smart?\u201d\nThe Samuel in question is Samuel Morse. The opposite of each word is derived by writing each word in morse code and swapping the dots and dashes, ignoring spaces. In this case ...--.-.-.- transforms to ---..-.-.-., which translates to \u201coften\u201d \u2013 the answer to the question and one of four words in the url of section four. PUZZLE FOUR \u2013 THE IP ADDRESS In part four, players are asked to find the missing number in three sequences, the solutions of which can be used to generate an IP address. The challenge proved the hardest to crack online, with several users opting to use \u201cbrute force\u201d trial and error to guess to correct answers.\nAll three sequences contain a string of numbers seemingly completely unrelated. The third and final question in the puzzle read simply: \u201c321, 444, 675, 680, 370, 268, 949, 206, 851, ?\u201d The answer, revealed by breaking the numbers into their three digits and sequences separately, was revealed as 208. PUZZLE FIVE \u2013 THE FINAL TEST Part five, according to a screengrab of the GCHQ web page posted by one user, is the final stage, in which users are asked to consider a grid of 55 words, and work out where one additional word, CYBER, should sit within it.\nBy early evening on Thursday, no successful answers had been posted on the Reddit thread. The race, however, is unquestionably on.\n",

        "body": "The British government is \u201ctreating the entire nation as suspects\u201d by ignoring safeguards on retaining and accessing personal communications data, according to the Conservative MP David Davis. Speaking before the opening of a test case at the European court of justice (ECJ), the former home affairs spokesman called for improved protections to prevent state abuses through bulk interception of private emails and online exchanges. Davis and the Labour deputy leader, Tom Watson, have jointly challenged the legality of the government\u2019s Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014 (Dripa).\nThe case before 15 European judges in Luxembourg comes in the middle of the UK\u2019s EU referendum campaign and is likely to have a significant impact on the controversial investigatory powers bill now before parliament. It also follows the jihadi atrocities in Paris and Brussels, which have reinforced political demands for the expansion of powers to intercept emails and phone calls to help catch Islamic State militants operating on the continent. At the opening of the test case on Tuesday, lawyers for the UK government said intercepted communications had been at the heart of every terrorist case investigated by police and the security services in recent years. Dan Beard QC told the court: \u201cWe have multiple examples of communications data being critical in securing convictions. It has also been used to prove people innocent and to find missing victims. \u201cWhen I make a call \u2026 I\u2019m billed and the telecoms company holds the communications data. My call has a digital footprint and it persists in the digital sand for some time. \u201cThe measures at the heart of this [case] are, at most, simply extending the time of retention. They hold back the tide and stop the footprints being washed away \u2026 Telecoms companies are not being asked to get information they would otherwise not have. It\u2019s not concerned with the content of any communications data \u2026 \u201c[Data retention] is not a wholesale sweep up. [Investigators] have to obtain specific permission to access communications data. There\u2019s a strict process of approval. Using communications data can identify contacts between people and to some extent identify locations. That\u2019s why the data is valuable. \u201cThis is not about extinguishing privacy rights. It\u2019s [about] striking a balance and each member state does that differently.\u201d Revelations by the US whistleblower Edward Snowden have shown that intelligence agencies are able to carry out widespread surveillance and hacking of suspects\u2019 computers. Fifteen EU states have intervened in the case, many seeking to make significant changes to the impact of a previous landmark judgment, known as Digital Rights Ireland, which established safeguards for retention of communications data. Privacy groups and the two British MPs are urging the court to uphold existing safeguards established by the case. The high court in London has already ruled that the powers in Dripa are inconsistent with European Union law and, as a result, those powers are due to expire at the end of this year. The court of appeal is asking the ECJ to clarify the impact of the Digital Rights Ireland decision. Dinah Rose QC, representing Watson and Davis, told the hearing: \u201cIt\u2019s no part of our case to challenge or dispute the importance of retaining communications data in the fight against terror and serious crime. Our point is simply that protecting our democratic values is also important in resisting terror. \u201cInterception of communications is interference with democratic rights. If a state considers that interference to be necessary then it\u2019s essential for it to put in place proper safeguards. The UK does not provide proper safeguards and it\u2019s unlawful for that reason. \u201cThe UK does not dispute that the public interest aims [of the EU\u2019s e-privacy directive] can\u2019t be met by their safeguards. The UK position is that it\u2019s simply under no obligation to implement them. \u201cThe fact that so many member states are seeking to dilute the standards shows the necessity of the [ECJ] taking a clear line in defining what are minimum standards. Individuals whose data has been accessed have no right to be informed even if that access was unlawful. The UK permits an immigration inspector to access an asylum seekers\u2019 [data] even if they are not suspected of any crime, or those taking part in demonstrations. There\u2019s no seriousness threshold.\u201d Jessica Simor QC, a barrister representing the Open Rights Group and Privacy International, told the hearing: \u201cA number of states seek to persuade you to reverse your position in Digital Rights Ireland \u2026 this would amount to your court judicially amending rules adopted by the EU parliament \u2026 Wholesale, mass retention of data is not permissible under the EU\u2019s e-privacy directive.\u201d Earlier Davis, a Eurosceptic who is attending the hearing in Luxembourg, explained that although he supports a British bill of rights to repatriate judicial supremacy, he accepts that for now the ECJ decision will be decisive. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be a supreme court of some sort,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the moment this [the ECJ] is it. When we are out [of the EU], we will have a supreme court with a British bill of rights.\u201d He sasid Dripa had been pushed through parliament in one day, with no briefing and no time to discuss it. \u201cIt was an abuse of democracy. Sometimes if parliament does not [stop it], someone else has to do so.\u201d Some bulk data retention was necessary, Davis acknowledged. \u201cIf it is destroyed, you can\u2019t follow up. But retention of data can still be dangerous. It can be misused by states. Large quantities of data attract criminals and fraudsters. Limited storing is necessary. \u201cThe British government is retaining far more than is necessary and treating the entire nation as suspects and that\u2019s not consistent with British laws.\u201d Davis said he suspected the government would try to get the Dripa case heard in Luxembourg before the investigatory powers bill went through all its stages so that it did not need to be revised later to ensure it was consistent with EU regulations. The 15 EU states party to the case, , which also relates to a dispute involving a Swedish telecoms company, are defending the principle of the mass retention of data. \u201cWholesale data retention is not a problem if it\u2019s compensated for by safeguards governing access to the data,\u201d a lawyer for the Czech government argued on Tuesday. \u201cIf mass retention was prohibited, then states would be excluded from a golden opportunity to prosecute for a considerable quantity of criminal activity.\u201d The Danish government\u2019s representative said: \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to know beforehand which data might be relevant in the future for solving criminal cases. Data retention provides investigators with the benefit of hindsight. To limit data retention, as described by the Digital Rights Ireland case, would be impractical if the aim is to prevent or detect crime.\u201d Anna Falk, a lawyer representing the Swedish government, said: \u201cThe feeling of unease that retention of data already arouses in individuals is largely based on a fear of what the authorities [might do with it]. There has to be \u2026 proportionate rules on the data retention. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible to meet the very important interest in combating crime in any other way than through a general retention of data.\u201d\n",

        "body": "On the Friday afternoon before the presidential election, Ahmed was at home with his family in Texas, when he heard a knock at the door. He answered in an undershirt and shorts, and found two men who were dressed casually. It was the FBI. Ahmed, a doctor, who says he\u2019s never even had a parking ticket, was at first surprised and then scared. \u201cI didn\u2019t know my rights,\u201d Ahmed, whose name has been changed for fear of reprisal, told the Guardian, \u201cthat I could tell them to reschedule it or I could refuse to talk to them.\u201d Ahmed was one of at least 109 people who contacted the Council of American Islamic Relations (Cair) to say they were visited by the FBI days before the election. Donald Trump\u2019s subsequent victory has raised fears of increased surveillance against the Muslim community, and the possibility of a Muslim registry. But it is also mobilizing some activists to ratchet up challenges to FBI policing rules already in place that allow for sweeps that may profile Muslims. \u201cWe see people mobilizing like there\u2019s no tomorrow,\u201d said Alia Salem, executive director of the Dallas/Fort Worth chapter of Cair. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be having these conversations about how to improve things if Hillary Clinton got elected.\u201d At Ahmed\u2019s house, the agents told him they had intelligence of a possible terrorist attack on election day following the death of al-Qaida leader Farouq al Qahtani al-Qatari, in a US airstrike in Afghanistan. They just wanted to ask him a few questions. \u201cAt that time, I said, Let me put my shirt on and came back,\u201d Ahmed recalled. He let the agents into his home and they sat at his couch for 45 minutes. Ahmed, an American citizen, is originally from Pakistan and had travelled home a few times in the past decade. The FBI agents probed his history to learn more about his family, charitable donations, hobbies and more. The question of the al-Qaida leader faded away. Salem put out a video on Twitter warning Muslims of their rights when approached by the FBI after their office received a phone call. The video was distributed widely and sparked dozens of calls of people recounting similar experiences to Ahmed. The FBI did not respond to a request for a comment. Hassan Shibly, Cair-Florida\u2019s chief executivedirector, said he also received a flurry of calls from predominantly Pakistani or Afghan Muslims, many of whom were doctors. \u201cWe basically discovered that it was a nationwide sweep,\u201d Shibly said. \u201cSimply based on their faith and ethnicity.\u201d He also added that the proximity to the election may have suppressed voter turnout. Shibly said the calls came from at least 12 different states where Muslims said they were visited by agents asking about the death of al-Qahtani and wanting to ask more questions. Alia said they fielded 220 calls, mostly South Asian or Afghan men ranging from 18 to their 60s, many of whom were professionals, and people that had recently changed their immigration status. The day after the sweep was Trump\u2019s shock election victory, which brought with it fears that he would fulfill his promises to implement draconian measures against Muslims. And soon a reported increase in alleged hate crimes. But Salem said fear about the prospect of a Trump presidency has sparked conversations around a lot of the measures Muslims have been submitted to under the Obama administration. Mike German, a former FBI agent and fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, said reports of the FBI pre-election sweep raised civil rights alarm bells. \u201cThe idea that the FBI would do that days before an election is a bit shocking,\u201d German added. \u201cParticularly when the information they\u2019re providing is that there\u2019s a potential threat to the election so that would suggest going to vote would be dangerous and that they\u2019re specifically targeting groups by their religious beliefs, I think is quite inappropriate.\u201d He said the fact that the agents spread out across so many states indicates they did not have very specific information. \u201cWhen an FBI agent does an investigation, they\u2019re looking for very specific pieces of the puzzle they think that the witness they\u2019re interviewing possesses,\u201d German explained. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t seem like what was going on here.\u201d German said this type of broad targeting of Muslims has happened in the past. It\u2019s a similar tactic used against political activists before conventions, or crime organizations that the FBI believes is likely to stage an attack, to put people on notice. The FBI is allowed to conduct broad sweeps after interviewing guidelines were loosened during the George W Bush administration by then-attorney general, Michael Mukasey in 2008. Mukasey\u2019s ruling modified the bureau\u2019s operation guide to allow for an \u201cassessment\u201d period. During this period, agents can conduct investigations without factual information that a threat is posed. German warned that these guidelines give the Trump administration extraordinary leeway to undertake even broader blanket operations. \u201cWith some of the campaign rhetoric that pandered to racism against Mexican immigrants and the Muslim community, I would be concerned that the lax FBI guidelines would empower any agents who held those sentiments to conduct intrusive investigations,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great concern to any of us working on this issues.\u201d The guidelines also make it difficult for oversight boards to rein in any behaviour that\u2019s deemed to be improper as the permissions are so broad. Ahmed\u2019s interview was expansive. While the tone was very cordial throughout, the agents pushed for a range of information that seemed unrelated to the election or the death of an al-Qaida leader. However, there was one moment of slight tension when an agent said, \u201cIslamic values do not align with the local cultural values\u201d, which Ahmed said he took issue with. After they left, Ahmed said he felt at first confused and then scared. He wondered if somebody in his area or at work had reported him and his family and why they would do so. \u201cWe are very friendly with our neighbors. Our kids play with each other. They leave you with a lot of questions,\u201d he said. \u201cIt definitely terrified me and scared me.\u201d \u201cIt scares my family, and leaves you in speechless condition.\u201d\n",

        "body": "It is a rare thing to bring truth to bear on the most powerful and secretive arm of the state. Never before has the Investigatory Powers Tribunal \u2013 the British court tasked with reviewing complaints against the security services \u2013 ruled against the government. Not once have the spooks been taken to task for overstepping the lawful boundaries of their conduct. Not a single British spy has been held accountable for mass surveillance, unlawful spying or snooping on private emails and phone calls. Until today. Privacy International has spent the past 25 years fighting back against the ever-expanding British surveillance state. Together with our allies, we\u2019ve resisted the snooper\u2019s charter (multiple times), mandatory ID cards and the provision of passenger name records. Yet in June 2013 we were as shocked as everyone else to learn that GCHQ, in collaboration with the NSA, had acquired the capabilities to completely control, monitor, copy, read and analyse the world\u2019s private communications. It was, until that point, unfathomable that the security services could have so audaciously stretched the boundaries of democratic legitimacy \u2013 and could have so severely violated the civil liberties and human rights of not only Britons, but of hundreds of millions of innocent people across the globe. Thanks to Edward Snowden, we learned that GCHQ has access to emails and messages that the NSA siphons off directly and en masse from Google, Skype and Facebook. We discovered that the NSA collects 194m text messages and 5bn location records every day \u2013 and GCHQ can read them too. And, of course, we learned that GCHQ is operating a mass surveillance system that, combined with its access to the NSA\u2019s own mass surveillance architecture, means it can read almost anyone\u2019s communications, at any time, without judicial authorisation or any meaningful oversight. In July 2013, the Intelligence and Security Committee assured us that GCHQ access to NSA surveillance material, in particular through the Prism programme, was entirely lawful. Unsurprisingly, we did not find the reassurances of a body that has consistently and blindly backed the services that it is meant to scrutinise comforting. That\u2019s why we decided to take GCHQ to court. Alongside Liberty, Amnesty International and human rights organisations from around the world, we argued that mass surveillance is not an acceptable activity of a democratic government, and that the cosy dealings between GCHQ and the NSA, conducted under a veil of secrecy that was only lifted by a whistleblower\u2019s bravery, had to be brought within public control and scrutiny. The evidence was overwhelming and the history of human rights law was in our favour, but the tribunal \u2013 which at that point had never before found that the surveillance activities of GCHQ broke the law \u2013 disagreed. Mass surveillance, it found in its decision of December 2014, was legitimate under British law. GCHQ\u2019s access to NSA mass surveillance was also acceptable, it said, given that the government had disclosed details of its relationship with the US during the course of our case. The decision was a disappointing one, and we\u2019ll soon appeal to the European court of human rights. But it left us with a small glimmer of hope. The tribunal said that it was lawful for GCHQ and the NSA to swap and share surveillance material only because GCHQ has secret internal policies that it reluctantly disclosed in response to Privacy International\u2019s case. Now that those secret policies are no longer secret, the court reasoned, the British public know what\u2019s going on, and that in itself must make those activities lawful. It must follow, therefore, that before those policies were public \u2013 prior to Edward Snowden\u2019s disclosures, and our case in the IPT \u2013 GCHQ was acting outside the law. Complicated reasoning aside, this finding was a genuine \u2013 and rare \u2013 success. The tribunal agreed, and we today have a firm statement that the intelligence services were acting completely out of bounds. It is not the judgment we would have liked \u2013 that we still hope to get from the European court of human rights in Strasbourg later this year \u2013 but it is a significant victory against an arm of the state that has rarely been forced to account for its wrongdoings. It is a vindication of Snowden, and all those who put their careers \u2013 and even their lives \u2013 on the line to ensure the truth was told. It is a huge encouragement to civil society organisations like Privacy International, which often spend years locked in David and Goliath battles, depleting their funds and their morale to perform the essential role of holding truth to power. In years to come we will look back on today as an essential victory against the surveillance state. Here at Privacy International, we humbly hope that perhaps we will also look back at this day as a turning of the tide; the day when the seemingly uncontrollable advancement of state intrusion into individuals\u2019 lives was halted, and when internet users reclaimed some of the power in their fight for privacy, security and free expression. Perhaps today will be the day that the government realises it cannot continue to expand its powers, outlaw encryption, and ban private speech in private places. Perhaps this victory will be the first of many \u2013 in the IPT, where Reprieve will soon protest the surveillance of lawyers, in the high court, where David Davis and Tom Watson are challenging blanket data retention laws, and in Strasbourg, where the European court of human rights has the opportunity to end mass surveillance once and for all. Perhaps this will spell the beginning of the end of unlawful, excessive, invasive intrusion into our private lives.\n",

        "body": "Few communities in the US should be as concerned about Ted Cruz\u2019s proposal to aggressively surveil Muslims than Brooklyn\u2019s Bay Ridge. The neighborhood is home to one of the largest Muslim enclaves in the country, estimated at over 30,000. A walk down Fourth Avenue will turn up as many shop awnings in Arabic as in English, and women in hijab and niqab are as common a sight as business suits in Manhattan\u2019s financial district. But here, perhaps as much as anywhere, the reaction for many is closer to apathy. Cruz\u2019s comments \u201cseem like a revelation to everyone else and my response is that it\u2019s already been happening,\u201d said Linda Sarsour, executive director of the Arab-American Association of New York. Sarsour, a lifelong Brooklynite and Bay Ridge resident added: \u201cMuslim communities around the country have been under constant surveillance for the past 15 years.\u201d\nCruz, currently second in the race for the Republican nomination, proposed that law enforcement officials ramp up efforts to \u201cpatrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods\u201d in response to the terror attacks in the Belgian capital of Brussels on Tuesday. Isis has claimed credit for the bombings that left 31 people dead and more than 200 injured. But as Sarsour observed, such a program is nothing new. The NYPD famously embarked on an expansive dragnet of surveillance efforts directed at the city\u2019s Muslim residents in the wake of 9/11. One of those programs \u2013 known as the demographics unit \u2013 was assembled to study and map 28 \u201cancestries of interest\u201d, the Associated Press reported in 2011, most of them Muslim. Undercover officers in this unit were tasked with visiting community locations like bookstores and cafes to look for \u201chot spots\u201d of potential extremist sentiment. Faisal, a 17-year-old Bay Ridge resident said he couldn\u2019t remember a time before the possibility of surveillance was a normal part of life. \u201cIt\u2019s just part of growing up Muslim in New York, I guess,\u201d he said, shrugging. The NYPD suspended its demographics program under Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s direction in 2014, a move Cruz described on Wednesday as a kowtow to \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d. New York, Cruz said in a statement, \u201csuccumbed to unfounded criticisms and eliminated the efforts of law enforcement to work with Muslim communities to stop radical Islamic terrorism.\u201d New York officials fired back quickly, with the mayor\u2019s office calling Cruz\u2019s statement \u201cblatantly false\u201d and police commissioner Bill Bratton calling the plan out of step with American values. Bratton added \u201cthe statements [Cruz] made today is why he\u2019s not going to become president of this country.\u201d The city is facing continued litigation over the surveillance of Muslims including the pending case of Hassan v City of New York, which is seeking to have the courts declare the surveillance program unconstitutional, order the NYPD to \u201cimmediately stop spying on our clients\u201d, and destroy any records related to the programs. Omar Fareh, one of the attorneys arguing the case for the Center for Constitutional Rights said \u201cblanket, discriminatory policing of a religious group \u2013 based as it is on crude stereotypes \u2013 simply does not work. It was right of Mr Bratton to acknowledge as much in his recent remarks.\u201d Bratton even defended the abandoning of the demographics program in November, claiming \u201cnot one single piece of actionable intelligence ever came out of that unit in its years of existence\u201d. Sarsour said the end of the program was welcome, but added by the time it was shut down, \u201cit had already accomplished its mission to map the Muslim community. They know where we are.\u201d\nThe now-defunct demographics unit did not encompass the sum of the NYPD surveillance tactics that activists and community members find far more distressing, either. In the same November press conference where Bratton defended the end of the program he spoke cheerfully about the other methods for identifying threats like \u201csocial media, use of informants\u201d and the \u201cdevelopment of relationships\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s no shortage of ability to get intelligence,\u201d Bratton said at the time. Fahd Ahmed knows these methods well. Ahmed is the acting executive director of the South Asian Organizing Center, which has been protesting and promoting activism around Muslim profiling since 9/11. He recalls in 2012 how during a protest against the police for the very act of surveillance, \u201cwe had someone come join our contingent who we later found out was an NYPD informant,\u201d Ahmed said. \u201cHe kept coming to events. Not really knowing people, not really socializing with people and building connections \u2013 just showing up.\u201d Defenders of these informant programs say they have led to the diffusion of credible threats, like the 2004 arrest of Shahawar Matin Siraj and James Elshafay for an alleged bombing plot on the New York City subway system planned with an informant. Detractors argue that these informant interactions amount to entrapment, preying on impressionable young minds. Ahmed said the city made \u201ca lot of fanfare\u201d out of the closing of the demographics unit, but stressed it was virtually defunct anyways. \u201cThe other programs that actually were spying and doing intelligence gathering in the community continue,\u201d he said.\nMore recently, in January the city settled a lawsuit that accused the NYPD of suspicionless and warrantless blanket surveillance, agreeing to not pursue investigations where \u201crace, religion, or ethnicity is the substantial or motivating factor.\u201d But in the settlement the department admitted to no \u201cimproper practices\u201d and claimed that the anti-discrimination component was just a reiteration of what had been their policy all along. But Zein Rimawi doesn\u2019t fully recognize that NYPD. The Palestinian-American immigrated to Bay Ridge from a small town north-west of Jerusalem in 1982 and said post-9/11 profiling has \u201cterrorized\u201d him and his family. \u201cThey came to my house, they came to my business, and they stop me in the street,\u201d Rimawi said. He is a board member of the Arab Muslim American Federation and is very active in the local Muslim community. Rimawi, who has been employed in a variety of fields, now works coordinating a senior center where older New Yorkers, mostly Arab-Americans, come for meals and activities. In his opinion the relationship between the the local precinct in Bay Ridge and the Muslim community is actually \u201cvery strong\u201d, but he added \u201cthese other officers come from Manhattan with these programs and who knows what they\u2019re thinking.\u201d As for Cruz, and the Republican frontrunner, Donald Trump, who has repeatedly proposed a moratorium on Muslims entering the US, Rimawi said their overblown rhetoric is making the post-9/11 attitude towards Muslims look like \u201ca honeymoon\u201d. But Rimawi was not wavered by any of it. \u201cWe cannot go anywhere else. We\u2019re here. Maybe they don\u2019t love us but we love them. It\u2019s up to the people whether they will accept us,\u201d he said.\n",

Originally BlackBerry was due to pull out in November, but the ban on its servers was put back by a month by Pakistan. BlackBerry chief operating officer Marty Beard said: \u201cThe truth is that the Pakistani government wanted the ability to monitor all BlackBerry Enterprise Service traffic in the country, including every email and BBM message. But BlackBerry will not comply with that sort of directive. \u201cWe do not support \u2018back doors\u2019 granting open access to our customers\u2019 information and have never done this anywhere in the world.\u201d Pakistan\u2019s Telecommunications Authority ordered mobile phone operators and BlackBerry to cease using BlackBerry servers in July for \u201csecurity reasons\u201d. BlackBerry\u2019s secure servers cannot be intercepted by the Pakistan government, meaning that messaging services, email and browsing can be obfuscated from snooping. But BlackBerry insists that it will respond to \u201clawful government investigative requests of criminal activity\u201d. Beard said: \u201cPakistan\u2019s demand was not a question of public safety; we are more than happy to assist law enforcement agencies in investigations of criminal activity. Rather, Pakistan was essentially demanding unfettered access to all of our BES customers\u2019 information. The privacy of our customers is paramount to BlackBerry, and we will not compromise that principle.\u201d BlackBerry has faced similar problems in the past in India, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Indonesia. In 2010, BlackBerry services were banned within the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Bans were lifted in some states but with tightened restrictions. For Pakistan, BlackBerry\u2019s exit comes after a ramping up of government surveillance, which Privacy International said was an abuse of communications surveillance powers, including widespread internet-monitoring and censorship. BlackBerry left on the line as UK users continue to hang up\n",

        "body": "Presidential candidates from both parties came together at the weekend to call for beefed-up government surveillance programs in the wake of recent terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California. The candidates did not agree, however, on what kind of surveillance \u2013 new dragnet metadata collection, tools to fight encryption or some even more powerful capability \u2013 was needed. The debate broke out as the contrasting methods of communication \u2013 and possibly encryption \u2013 used by attackers in the two assaults demonstrated the difficulty of detecting and interrupting nascent plots, whether involving suspects known to authorities, as in Paris, or unknown, as in California. The attackers in Paris, at least three of whom had been subject to surveillance, used Facebook to communicate and coordinated using unencrypted SMS text messages. The California suspects were revealed to have communicated with surveillance targets or suspects, but were not targets themselves, Republican hopeful John Kasich said on Sunday. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner, said that big technology companies and social sharing sites were \u201cgoing to have to help us\u201d in the effort to interrupt potential plots. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need help from Facebook, and from YouTube, and from Twitter,\u201d Clinton said on ABC News. \u201cThey cannot permit the recruitment and the actual direction of attacks, or the celebration of violence by this sophisticated internet user. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have to help us take down these announcements and these appeals as quickly as they get up.\u201d The female suspect in the California shooting, Tashfeen Malik, had reportedly posted a message in praise of the Isis leader before the attack. Facebook executives later suspended her account because it violated the company\u2019s policy of preventing terror groups from using the site to organize and disseminate propaganda. Donald Trump, the Republican frontrunner, said the San Bernardino attack, in which a couple killed 14 people and injured 21 at a community center, displayed a need for \u201cvery tough\u201d surveillance measures including tracking entire families. \u201cWe have to start looking at families now,\u201d Trump said at a Saturday whistle stop in Iowa, referring to suspect Syed Rizwan Farook. \u201cI think his mother knew what was going on. She went into the apartment. Anybody that went into that house or that apartment knew what was going on. We better get a little tough and a little smart, or we\u2019re in trouble.\u201d Trump has called for surveillance of some mosques and has not ruled out the government maintaining a database of American Muslims. Jeb Bush, who has previously called the Muslim database suggestion \u201cabhorrent\u201d, said on Sunday that he stood by that assessment. \u201cWe have all of the capabilities to monitor people that are in our country trying to attack us,\u201d Bush said on ABC News. \u201cThat already exists, and I think that\u2019s more than appropriate. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to target the religion, we just have to target those that have co-opted the religion and make sure we\u2019re fully aware of the radicalizations taking place not just here, but around the world.\u201d The Republicans diverged notably in their diagnoses of what new surveillance was needed to prevent future attacks. Kasich said the California attackers\u2019 ability to escape detection at a time of sweeping bulk collection in previous years indicated that the suspects had used encryption technology. Marco Rubio, the Florida senator also running for president, said restrictions on dragnet collection of metadata was the problem, blaming Barack Obama for signing legislation last summer, the Freedom Act, that forced the government to rely on phone companies to keep data on customers. Though metadata collection and analysis had apparently failed to identify Farook, who was born in the United States, and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, as security risks, the program should be redoubled, Rubio said. \u201c[Analysts] can\u2019t put together the broader picture of who these people are, who they\u2019ve been dealing with \u2013 particularly the man who\u2019s been in this country his whole life. Wouldn\u2019t we want to know as much about him as possible, in an effort to perhaps identify others that were of assistance in this attack?\u201d Rubio said on CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly why the metadata program is so critical. People wind up on your radar who perhaps wouldn\u2019t have been on your radar.\u201d Both Clinton and Kasich called for a new deal between the government and tech companies to circumvent encryption \u2013 but the companies have been resistant to such a deal, arguing that it would put too much private customer information at risk. In June, Apple CEO Tim Cook attacked rivals Google and Facebook for being too willing, he said, to turn over customer information. Clinton called on \u201cthe best minds in the private sector and public sector\u201d to \u201ccome together to help us deal with this evolving threat\u201d. \u201cNobody wants to be feeling like their privacy is invaded,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cBut I also know what the argument is on the other side from law enforcement and security professionals. So please, let\u2019s get together and figure out the best way forward.\u201d\n",

        "body": "The government\u2019s electronic eavesdropping agency GCHQ spied illegally on Amnesty International, according to the tribunal responsible for handling complaints against the intelligence services. Confirmation that surveillance took place emerged late on Wednesday, when the human rights group revealed that the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) sent it an email correcting an earlier judgment. The extraordinary revision of a key detail in the ruling given on 22 June may alarm many supporters of Amnesty, who will want to know why it has been targeted. In the original judgment, the IPT said that communications by the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights and the South African non-profit Legal Resources Centre had been illegally retained and examined. In the email sent on Wednesday, the tribunal made it clear that it was Amnesty and not the Egyptian organisation that had been spied on \u2013 as well as the Legal Resources Centre in South Africa. The breach of surveillance powers, under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, related to retaining databases for longer than was permitted. Amnesty had been one of the claimants in the case, but in the original judgment the IPT made \u201cno determination\u201d on the organisation\u2019s complaint \u2013 implying that either their emails and phone calls were not intercepted or that they were intercepted but by legal means. Responding to the revelation, Salil Shetty, Amnesty International\u2019s secretary general, said: \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous that what has been often presented as being the domain of despotic rulers has been done on British soil, by the British government. \u201cHow can we be expected to carry out our crucial work around the world if human rights defenders and victims of abuse can now credibly believe their confidential correspondence with us is likely to end up in the hands of governments?\n\u201cAfter 18 months of litigation and all the denials and subterfuge that entailed, we now have confirmation that we were in fact subjected to UK government mass surveillance. The revelation that the UK government has been spying on Amnesty International highlights the gross inadequacies in the UK\u2019s surveillance legislation. \u201cIf they hadn\u2019t stored our communications for longer than they were allowed to, we would never even have known. What\u2019s worse, this would have been considered perfectly lawful.\u201d The IPT email made no mention of when or why Amnesty International was spied on, or what was done with the information obtained. The organisation is calling for an independent inquiry into how and why a UK intelligence agency has been spying on human rights organisations. Eric King, deputy director of Privacy International, which also took a similar case to the IPT, said: \u201cOur system of oversight and remedy has fundamentally failed. The communications of one of the world\u2019s leading human rights organisations \u2013 Amnesty International \u2013 were targeted by British spies, unlawfully, and our commissioners and courts failed to admit it, depriving individuals around the world of the validation and condemnation of, and redress for, unlawful government practices that is so desperately needed. \u201cWithout Edward Snowden, without an 18-month legal battle, without an honest reckoning by whichever upstanding individual spotted and admitted this grave error, the unlawful conduct of the British intelligence agencies would never have been exposed by the very court charged with exposing it. \u201cToday\u2019s farcical developments places into sharp relief the obvious problems with secret tribunals where only one side gets to see, and challenge, the evidence. Five experienced judges inspected the secret evidence, seemingly didn\u2019t understand it, and wrote a judgement that turned out to be untrue. We need to know why and how this happened. \u201cAny confidence that our current oversight could keep GCHQ in check has evaporated. Only radical reforms will ensure this never happens again.\u201d Issuing an apology, the IPT said: \u201cThe tribunal regrets the error which led to the mistaken attribution in its determination, but would emphasise that such error had no impact upon, and occurred after, its careful consideration and judicial determination of the facts before it.\u201d\n",

        "body": "Prosecutors disclosed last week that up to 14 police officers had been deployed to spy on the sister of a former paratrooper who was unlawfully killed in a police station. But the unanswered question remains - what is the full extent of the police\u2019s covert monitoring of her? For more than 15 years, Janet Alder has been campaigning to find out what happened when her brother, Christopher, died in a Hull police station. His death has been one of the most contentious in police custody. It makes for disturbing reading. It is worth recapping what has happened. In April 1998, Christopher, a father-of-two Falklands veteran, choked to death on the floor of the police station. Police officers stood by chatting and joking as he struggled for breath, with his trousers and boxer shorts pulled down around his knees.\nCCTV film shows that as he lost his fight for life, he received no help from the officers, who thought he was play-acting. It took 11 minutes for the handcuffed ex-soldier to stop breathing. Afterwards, as he lay dead, an audio tape recorded monkey-noises. The jury in an inquest in 2000 concluded that he had been unlawfully killed. A prosecution brought against police officers resulted in acquittals. The Alder family has not been treated well by the authorities. Four years ago, the government formally apologised to the family for the failures in the investigation into his death. In 2011, Hull City Council also admitted that Christopher\u2019s relatives had mistakenly buried the body of a 77-year-old woman when they thought that they were burying him. Two years ago, it emerged that the official watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission, had started an investigation into allegations that police had placed Janet and another person under improper surveillance. Last Thursday, the Crown Prosecution Service decided that four senior officers in charge of the surveillance were not going to be charged. However the CPS did give an account of how she had been put under surveillance, adding that the evidence indicated that the operation against her had not been properly authorised.\nThere was evidence that up to 14 police officers had been involved in following her, her barrister and her supporters after the inquest into Christopher\u2019s death had been adjourned one day. The CPS described an allegation that police had attempted to eavesdrop on her and her barrister. Alder said she felt \u201cterrorised by the state\u201d, adding that she feared that police had been monitoring her since she had started campaigning. That question of how far the police have been spying on her has yet to be answered. The account given by the CPS last Thursday describes a surveillance operation against Alder on only one day of the inquest - July 28 2000. We only know about this because a detective constable involved in the surveillance on that day came forward two years ago and told her superiors. But is it really the case that police carried out surveillance on her for only one day of the six-week inquest? This was at a time when senior officers had twice authorised the monitoring of her supporters outside the hearing for the whole duration of the inquest in July and August 2000. The police had justified this monitoring on the grounds that there could be public disorder outside the hearing. In its account, the CPS disclosed that many of the officers involved in the surveillance had declined to be questioned by the IPCC during its investigation, opting instead to provide prepared statements. The CPS also said that it could not clarify many details of the surveillance operation on July 28 2000 because police officers had a \u201climited recollection of events\u201d.\nGetting to the truth of the surveillance on that one day, let alone any other day of the inquest, has therefore been difficult. And here\u2019s another unanswered question - Janet has for many years tirelessly attended public meetings to raise awareness of her brother\u2019s death. Have the police, including undercover officers planted in political groups, been keeping records of her activities? Last year police admitted that undercover officers had gathered intelligence over two decades on 18 grieving families who had been unhappy with the conduct of the police. That will be among the issues that will be examined by the public inquiry into undercover policing that is being led by a senior judge, Lord Justice Pitchford. Pitchford has said that Alder\u2019s case raises an \u201cimportant issue for investigation\u201d, but at the moment, has declined to give her a key role in his inquiry. A proper investigation by the inquiry seems to be the best chance of getting to truth of this matter.\n",

        "body": "In the first substantive policy proposal by a presidential candidate since the attacks in Brussels on Tuesday, Senator Ted Cruz proposed reinstating an intrusive and controversial surveillance program that targeted Muslim neighborhoods in New York after the September 11 terrorists attacks. Elaborating on his call to \u201cpatrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods\u201d, Cruz said he would replicate the law enforcement policies of the former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg that allowed NYPD detectives to eavesdrop on Muslim Americans. \u201cIf you look here in the city of New York, New York had a proactive policing program that Mayor Michael Bloomberg championed to work cooperatively with the Muslim community to prevent radicalization,\u201d Cruz said. After a series of blasts left more than 30 dead and 250 wounded in the Belgian capital, the 2016 presidential candidates issued statements and appeared on cable news shows to express solidarity with the people of Europe and to outline their counter-terrorism proposals, highlighting the similarities among the Democratic candidates while exposing real differences among the three Republicans. On Tuesday, Trump reprised his call to temporarily bar Muslims from entering the US, which his Republican rivals have condemned, and suggested that harsh interrogation techniques, including torture, might have prevented the Brussels attacks. Cruz, meanwhile, called for the US to \u201cempower law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized\u201d. He added: \u201cThe days of the United States voluntarily surrendering to the enemy to show how progressive and enlightened we can be are at an end.\u201d Republican presidential candidate John Kasich said Cruz\u2019s proposal would lead to more \u201cpolarization\u201d and create \u201cdivisions\u201d\u2019 in American society. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner, and Bernie Sanders called for strengthening information sharing with European allies and standing in solidarity with the people of Belgium. On Wednesday, Clinton is expected to expand on her counter-terrorism agenda during a speech at Stanford University. On Tuesday, Cruz compared his plan to prevent radicalization and homegrown terror to cracking down on gang violence. \u201cIt is standard law enforcement \u2013 it is good law enforcement to focus on where threats are emanating from,\u201d he told reporters during a press conference in New York. Cruz also accused the current New York mayor, Bill de Blasio, of abolishing Bloomberg\u2019s surveillance policies \u201cin a pique of political correctness\u201d. The Texas senator railed against politicians who he believes are wrongly concerned with offending certain groups, declaring that \u201cpolitical correctness costs lives\u201d. The mayor\u2019s office called the characterization of De Blasio \u201cblatantly false\u201d. \u201cNow we know why everyone is calling Ted Cruz a liar,\u201d said Monica Klein, a spokeswoman for the mayor, in reference to Trump\u2019s preferred moniker for his Republican rival, \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d. The NYPD also responded in force: \u201cThe statement [Ted Cruz] made today is why he won\u2019t become president of this country,\u201d the NYPD commissioner, Bill Bratton, said on Tuesday. The programs, which were stopped in 2014 and have been the subject of a string of lawsuits, drew criticism from civil rights groups and even some security experts who argued that they sowed mistrust between law enforcement and Muslim American communities. Cruz called the program \u201csuccessful\u201d and lambasted the New York mayor for having \u201csuccumbed to unfounded criticisms\u201d when he disbanded it. Cruz also criticized President Obama for attending a baseball game in Cuba on Tuesday instead of returning home to address the attacks. \u201cIndeed today, President Obama is happily at a baseball game yucking it up with the Castros, communist dictators, rather than being in America and directing the effort to defeat Isis,\u201d said Cruz, whose father is Cuban.\n",

        "body": "The German parliament passed without much fuss legislation in October that vastly expanded the surveillance powers of the country\u2019s intelligence agencies. That it went through the Bundestag so easily was surprising given the still raw history of surveillance in Germany; first by the Nazis and then the near-blanket coverage of East Germany by its then intelligence agency, the Stasi. Nowhere else in western Europe is the issue of protection of privacy felt as strongly as in Germany. But the intelligence agencies managed to override privacy concerns, citing the string of terrorist attacks in France, Belgium and Germany itself. The cabinet, in response to the Berlin attack, agreed on Wednesday to a bill that would extend the use of CCTV to shopping centres, sports arenas, car parks and other public areas.\nDoes the Berlin attack make the case for increased surveillance? The attack at one level fails to make the case for mass surveillance. Privacy campaigners are not opposed to intelligence agencies and the police targeting suspects: that is what they are supposed to do and what they have always done. What privacy campaigners oppose is blanket surveillance of everyone, and argue that the Berlin attack did not require it: the suspect, Anis Amri, was already known to the security services through traditional forms of intelligence. In almost every terrorist act since the 9/11 attacks, those responsible were already on the radar of the intelligence agencies: the Boston bombers, the killers of Fusilier Lee Rigby in London, the attackers in Paris and Brussels. And now, Amri, the Tunisian being hunted by intelligence agencies across Europe as the prime suspect for the Berlin attack. Amri had been on a watchlist since January and under covert surveillance for several months. The intelligence agencies also knew he possessed various fake IDs and had links with Islamic State. But for a still undisclosed reason the intelligence agencies lost track of him. Privacy campaigners would argue that instead of wasting resources gathering and sifting through the volume of data being accumulated through mass surveillance, the resources would be better allocated in providing more personnel for targeted surveillance. One of the biggest problems facing all intelligence agencies is that mounting surveillance on an individual such as Amri, including tapping his phone, requires an enormous number of staff. Intelligence agencies are coy about exact figures, but on average surveillance of just one person might require 25 to 40 people. The agencies have to make hard decisions about who they will watch full time and they make mistakes \u2013 as the British intelligence agencies did in the Rigby case.\nRichard Barrett, who was head of counter-terrorism at the UK\u2019s foreign intelligence agency MI6, told BBC Radio 4 that it was understandable how some people slipped through the net. He said there were 7,000 live cases in Germany \u2013 people suspected of being in touch with extremist groups and worthy of investigation \u2013 of whom 550 were \u201creally extreme potential terrorists\u201d. He said: \u201cAs you can imagine, that is an almost impossible number to control.\u201d It is nearly impossible for the agencies to get it right time after time. This is because they are having to deal not just with suspects such as Amri but the \u201clone wolf\u201d \u2013 an individual who has not attracted attention but who mounts a spontaneous attack after watching propaganda from groups such as Isis. Al-Qaida plotters focus on spectacular terrorist attacks such as bringing down planes. Isis has opted so far for low-tech attacks and its recent propaganda has encouraged lone wolves, even suggesting using trucks. Raffaello Pantucci, director of international security studies at London\u2019s Royal United Services Institute, said of the Berlin attack: \u201cClearly, there has been an intelligence failure.\u201d He said Germany was pretty good at human intelligence \u2013 gathering information on the ground \u2013 but not as good as the National Security Agency in the US or the UK\u2019s GCHQ at intercepting bulk communications. German intelligence relies on both of those countries sharing information with it. When the row over the NSA tapping of Merkel\u2019s phone broke in 2013, there were howls of protest from German politicians. The German intelligence agencies, as beneficiaries of some NSA data, did not protest too strongly but instead sought to use the row to leverage the NSA into providing it with even more data. Those who support mass surveillance, in particular the retention of digital data, would argue that the the Berlin attack justifies this approach. The New York Times reported US officials as saying that Amri had researched how to make bombs online and had contacted Isis at least once. The surveillance agencies would cite this as demonstrating the value of being able to access vast amounts of data that can be thoroughly searched. Cooperation in an international manhunt is relatively straightforward but European countries sharing intelligence is not in general. While the US and UK \u2013 and to a lesser extent Germany and France \u2013 have high levels of intelligence-sharing, Europe-wide cooperation is patchy. Countries such as the UK are reluctant to share intelligence with smaller European countries, fearful that sources might be compromised. While the UK would almost certainly pass on information if it thought an attack was imminent, less urgent information will often not be shared with countries with smaller intelligence agencies. After every European attack, there are calls for an organisation to be created that is more effective than Interpol and the other European agencies: a European CIA or FBI. But this has not been followed through and, given the differing capabilities of agencies across Europe, creation of such an agency appears unlikely.\n",

The Commons was asked to approve a timetable requiring the joint committee on the investigatory powers bill to report back by 11 February. The three-week Christmas and new year parliamentary recess means that the committee, which has yet to appoint a chair, will effectively have little more than three weeks to scrutinise the highly complex surveillance legislation and could have as few as three expert witness sessions. The joint committee that scrutinised the previous \u201csnooper\u2019s charter\u201d bill \u2013 the draft communications data bill \u2013 in 2012 sat for five months and held 13 public witness sessions over a six-week period. It also took evidence in private from the security services. One member of the committee, Lord Strasburger, tweeted: \u201cRidiculous. Committee scrutinising massive investigatory powers bill given just 2 weeks to hear witnesses. Govt turning it into rubber stamp.\u201d Alistair Carmichael, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said the rushed timetable risked discrediting the committee\u2019s work. \u201cThis inadequately short timescale makes it clear that despite reassurances from the home secretary in the aftermath of Paris, the government does in fact intend to rush this monumental bill through parliament,\u201d he said. \u201cProper scrutiny of complex issues requires time and care. The government seems determined to deny the committee both. I hope that members will not allow themselves to be railroaded in this way but will demand the time and resources that they need to produce a report of which they can be proud and in which the rest of us can have confidence.\u201d Privacy campaigners also voiced alarm. Eric King, of the Don\u2019t Spy On Us coalition of campaign groups, said: \u201cThis timetable is inhospitable to informed consideration of extraordinary powers. It is a fraction of the time previous versions of the snooper\u2019s charter received, which had just a fraction of the issues to consider. \u201cHow are the committee to weigh the proportionality of bulk interception powers, the intrusiveness of bulk hacking powers, or scrutinise the evidence base for internet connection records in just a matter of weeks? This is a once-in-a-generation chance to create a world-class legal framework. Rushing to hear evidence before Christmas jeopardises the chance to get it right,\u201d he said. A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cYesterday the House of Lords agreed the schedule for the investigatory powers bill joint scrutiny committee with no opposition. The committee has already started work and under the proposals will have two and a half months before reporting on 11 February 2016. It is for the committee to determine how to use the time available.\u201d The home secretary ruled out fast-tracking the bill in the wake of the Paris attacks, telling MPs that it was a significant bill and it was important that it had proper scrutiny.\n",

Police spied on Alder after she began campaigning to uncover the details of her brother Christopher\u2019s death in a Hull police station in April 1998. One of the most controversial deaths in police custody, it inspired a decade-long quest for the truth. \u201cI am absolutely appalled,\u201d Alder told the Guardian. \u201cI feel terrorised by the state.\u201d\nIn a letter sent to her on Thursday, the Crown Prosecution Service said it had decided not to charge four senior officers in charge of the surveillance after concluding that there was not enough evidence to secure a conviction of misconduct in public office. But it outlined evidence showing that surveillance officers followed Alder, her barrister and her supporters after a July 2000 hearing of the inquest into her brother\u2019s death. The CPS said that there was evidence that part of the surveillance team followed them to her hotel, while other members tracked another group to a car park. The second-in-command of the operation told an internal police inquiry that \u201csomebody went for a drink with a solicitor. One remit was to try and overhear the conversation.\u201d That comment \u201craises significant concern\u201d, the CPS added, as eavesdropping on legally protected conversations between a lawyer and their client is \u201cimproper and unlawful\u201d. Alder said that ever since she started campaigning over her brother\u2019s death, she had feared that the police were monitoring her. \u201cIt just confirmed everything I thought and that I was not being paranoid,\u201d she said. \u201cI never in my life knew anything like this - I always believed that the system did the right thing. For that to happen to me, it was so scary. I was just a normal working-class woman looking after my kids.\u201d With regard to the decision not to charge senior officers, a CPS spokeswoman said: \u201cAny prosecution would rely heavily on the evidence of police officers involved in the surveillance. As the events happened 15 years ago, the majority of the witnesses spoken to had, at best, a limited recollection of events.\u201d The CPS added that there was no \u201cclear or reliable evidence\u201d that the police had eavesdropped on her and her barrister. \u201cThis decision was supported by advice from external counsel,\u201d it added. The inquest in 2000 decided that Christopher Alder, a 37-year-old father of two, had been unlawfully killed. The Falklands veteran died in April 1998 handcuffed and face down on the floor of a Hull police station surrounded by police officers, after choking on his own vomit. CCTV footage recorded him gasping for breath as officers chatted and joked around him. They believed that Alder, whose trousers and pants had been pulled down to his ankles, was play-acting. Monkey-like noises could be heard as Alder lay dead. Five police officers put on trial for manslaughter and misconduct in public office were cleared on the orders of a judge two years later. Humberside police apologised to the family for failing to \u201ctreat Christopher with sufficient compassion\u201d.\nFour years ago, it emerged that Alder\u2019s family had buried an elderly woman instead of Christopher after his body was discovered in a hospital mortuary. The surveillance was revealed after a Humberside detective constable who was part of the operation directed against Alder come forward to her superiors two years ago. She acted after revelations that undercover police had spied on the family and supporters of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence. A two-year investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission found that police had authorised undercover surveillance of protesters outside the inquest at Hull crown court. Senior officers authorised the surveillance of the protesters, known as Operation Yarrow, for the whole of the six-week inquest. Officers were told to use \u201cmobile, foot and technical surveillance\u201d. Police anticipated that controversy over the paratrooper\u2019s death might result in public disorder, according to the CPS. There was evidence, however, that \u201cmembers of a surveillance team were directed to undertake, and did undertake, surveillance with a broader remit than that allowed for in the authorisations,\u201d the CPS said. It added that mobile and technical surveillance \u201cwas not properly authorised\u201d because it took place away from the court and commenced before it was meant to. Piers Arnold, an official in the CPS senior crime and terrorism division, wrote: \u201cIt is difficult to see how any such targeted surveillance could have been justified or directed at issues of public order which was the written justification for each of the surveillance authorities. \u201cFollowing the family of an alleged victim of police negligence/brutality and their legal representative instructed for an ongoing inquest into that death, whether or not it involved eavesdropping, would involve a high level of intrusion and require good reasons. No such reasons are discernible from the evidence.\u201d But he added that the evidence on who ordered the surveillance was too unclear to start a prosecution. The CPS believed that it was not possible to establish a motive for the surveillance. Alder said: \u201cThe police were trying to deflect attention away from the unlawful killing verdict of the inquest.\u201d A spokeswoman for Humberside police said: \u201cWe note the decision of the Crown Prosecution Service, which the family of Christopher Alder has the right to appeal.\u201d Police have come under growing criticism for covertly monitoring grieving families who have challenged their misconduct. An official report disclosed last year that undercover police officers had gathered intelligence on 18 families who had highlighted allegations of police wrongdoing. They include the parents of Stephen Lawrence, who was killed by a racist gang in 1993. Undercover officers also gathered intelligence on the relatives of Jean Charles de Menezes, the Brazilian electrician mistakenly shot dead by police in the aftermath of the 2005 terrorist attacks on London, and on Cherry Groce, who was shot and paralysed by police in a raid on her home in 1985. The death of 20-year-old student Ricky Reel, who in 1997 was found in a river after abuse by racists, also prompted intelligence operations on relatives. The undercover operations are to be examined at a public inquiry by Lord Justice Pitchford, which will scrutinise the theft of child identity and police spies\u2019 relationships with targeted women. Police have said intelligence on family campaigns was collected accidentally by undercover officers tasked with infiltrating political groups.\n",

        "body": "The phrase \u201csurveillance state\u201d normally crops up in connection with national security. Since the first duty of government is to the safety of the citizen, runs the standard script, then the faintest hope of preventing a single bomb can justify any amount of snooping on blameless citizens. It is an argument that this newspaper has often challenged, and for pragmatic as much as for principled reasons. But after the secrets of the Panama Papers escaped into the world, the striking thing is just how limp are the efforts of the same surveillance state when it comes to keeping track of the financial dealings of the rich. In the light of all the shell firms and confected financial flows facilitated by Mossack Fonseca, one might have thought that \u2013 for practical reasons of securing the tax base \u2013 Her Majesty\u2019s government would long ago have exerted the considerable leverage that it possesses over crown dependencies and overseas territories, to enable it to follow the money. Historically, however, there has been deep reluctance to do anything much, and even as pressure is belatedly applied, half-measures are deemed good enough. Overseas territories will continue to be spared from UK law on company registers, and there will be no requirement for a publicly accessible database of beneficial ownership, the UK satisfying itself instead with officials being able to inspect the information of service providers. Foreign office minister James Duddridge nonetheless praised such incremental efforts as \u201csuperb progress\u201d. The difference between the British state\u2019s nosiness in matters of security and matters of wealth is striking, but it is \u2013 perhaps \u2013 one Whitehall might defend with reference to that old line about the paramount importance of safety. The difficulty with running that argument is that another contrast has become evident this week, a big difference in the appetite for surveilling the finances of the rich, as opposed to the poor. After David Cameron was pressed by the SNP\u2019s Angus Robertson in the Commons on Wednesday, the government confirmed that it now deploys some 3,700 people to investigate benefit claimants, very often for modest sums, as opposed to the mere 700 Revenue staff who are tasked with looking into the affairs of, roughly speaking, the top 1%. Such\u00a0an imbalance of snooping resources looks less like the product of businesslike book-balancing than divisive class politics. At the same time, that blend of spying, strictures and fear-inducing penalties, which has slowly warped the process of claiming unemployment benefits into something more like being on probation, is starting to be extended from the jobless towards the low-paid. Iain Duncan Smith quietly took powers to impose so-called \u201cin-work conditionality\u201d several years ago, which in principle allowed poor workers to have their tax credits docked if they were judged not to be striving sufficiently to increase their wages or their hours of employment. Relatively little has happened in practice, because administrative chaos in welfare reform has precluded any dramatic advance in the frontiers of busy-bodying. The first experiments are, however, under way, and we reported this week on how one working woman from Widnes found herself \u201csanctioned\u201d for taking a holiday. The proper balance between individual privacy and the common good will often be contentious. But it should never be tipped by\u00a0whether you are rich or poor.\n",

        "body": "Social media companies including Twitter, Facebook and Google have come under pressure from MPs for failing to take tougher action to tackle hate speech online. During heated exchanges at the Commons home affairs committee one Labour MP went as far as accusing internet company executives of \u201ccommercial prostitution\u201d and demanding to know whether they had any shame. Yvette Cooper, the chair of the committee, told social media executives that they had \u201ca terrible reputation\u201d among their users for failing to act on reports of hate speech and other offensive material online.\nShe prepared for the evidence session on Tuesday by sending Google links to three YouTube videos posted by neo-Nazis including the US white supremacist, David Duke, and National Action, a banned organisation in Britain. Other MPs on the committee questioned why they could find hate speech material online \u201cwithin seconds\u201d on social media sites and how Islamic State supporters and neo-Nazi groups could earn advertising revenue through the videos they posted on YouTube. The social media companies defended their current monitoring arrangements but said they had to rely on their users on a \u201cnotify and take down\u201d basis to tackle the problem of online hate. The tech companies\u2019 sheer scale meant it was impossible for them to conduct proactive searches for such material although they were trying to develop technology, including artificial intelligence, that could improve their response to the problem. But Cooper told the companies their responses were unconvincing and they were not enforcing their own published community standards despite having millions of users in Britain and making billions of pounds from them. She cited examples of four tweets posted on Monday that made violent threats against public figures that she had reported to Twitter but remained online 24 hours later as the committee took evidence. They included one which referred to Angela Merkel saying she was \u201ca bitch that needed a bullet in the head\u201d. Others included such references to the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, and Gina Miller who brought the Brexit case against the government. Nick Pickles, Twitter\u2019s head of public policy for the UK, apologised to Cooper for not having looked at their community staff by the time of the hearing but said he expected they would be dealt with at the end of the day, especially as they involved violent threats. Pickles said three other Twitter accounts notified by the committee had been suspended but no action had been taken against a fourth which included the hashtag #deportallmuslims, as while \u201chighly offensive\u201d, it had not breached the company\u2019s community standards. The Twitter executive later declined to say how many staff it employed to work on safety and content moderation saying that if he gave a figure people would just say \u201cit is not enough\u201d. He told the MPs the company had recently rolled out technology to help identify accounts which break its rules, in addition to the system of user reporting: \u201cThat\u2019s a step change in how we deal with abuse. We are looking for it and will take action on content even when it hasn\u2019t been reported by users.\u201d\nPeter Barron, Google Europe\u2019s vice-president for communications and public affairs, said two of the three Youtube videos reported by the committee had been removed. But a fourth, a David Duke video entitled \u201cJews admit organising white genocide\u201d had not been removed despite being described by Cooper as antisemitic and shocking. Barron said while many Duke videos had been removed this particular one \u201cdid not cross the line into hate speech even though it was shocking and offensive in its nature\u201d. Simon Milner, EMEA policy director at Facebook, also tried to explain to the MPs why four Facebook pages all remained online including one entitled Ban Islam. He told the committee: \u201cThese pages in and of themselves do not violate because we make it clear that you can criticise religions. You cannot express hate against people because of their religion. So Ban Islam is a page which is designed to criticise Islam as a religion. It is not expressly, in and of itself, designed to attack Muslims.\u201d Milner insisted Facebook deployed a lot of time, effort and resource to tackling the problem. \u201cTo suggest we are in some way negligent or not caring about this issue is simply not true,\u201d he said. But the companies\u2019 responses seemed only to intensify the anger of the MPs. When one company executive explained why a Holocaust denial tweet did not breach its guidelines the veteran Labour MP, David Winnick, told the three executives that they were engaged in little more than \u201ccommercial prostitution\u201d and said he would be ashamed to earn his money in the way they did.\n",

        "body": "Under surveillance plans set out by the home secretary, Theresa May, a new high-profile investigatory powers (IP) commissioner will be at the heart of the government\u2019s planned reforms. They will head a team of about seven judicial commissioners, all of whom will have to have served as high court or appeal judges. Their most important job will be to approve warrants allowing interception of communications and examination of intercepted bulk material. And this will be a public-facing post, meaning they will be expected to appear on television and reassure the public.\nBut it is wrong for the home secretary to refer to them as judges. They will not be sitting in court or hearing arguments from both sides. They will need to be retrained. Although the draft bill includes a person \u201cwho holds or has held a high judicial office\u201d, nobody expects the post to go to anyone who is still sitting as a full-time judge. Quite apart from the additional workload, which might include being on call overnight, there would be potential conflicts of interest. So the new commissioners are likely to be retired judges, like the existing commissioners that they will replace. For the top job of IP commissioner, the prime minister will certainly be looking for a retired senior appeal judge. Three former judges are serving as commissioners at the moment. Lord Judge, 74, is chief surveillance commissioner. Sir Mark Waller, 75, is intelligence services commissioner. And Sir Stanley Burnton, 73, has just been appointed as interception of communications commissioner. All three posts are expected to lapse when the new legislation takes effect, at the end of next year. Lord Judge, a former lord chief justice of England and Wales, is the most senior of the three. But it\u2019s not at all certain that he would want to take on the new and highly demanding post of IP commissioner for a three-year period at the age of 75. The job might well appeal to the current lord chief justice, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, who is 68 and will reach mandatory retirement age during 2017.\nIt\u2019s intended that judicial commissioners will exercise an oversight role in addition to authorising warrants. To avoid accusations that they would be \u201cmarking their own homework\u201d, they would be split into two teams. The oversight commissioners will be supported by a team of inspectors. That structure applies already in the case of surveillance commissioners and was regarded as acceptable by David Anderson QC, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation. The need for warrants to be approved by judicial commissioners as well as ministers \u2013 referred to by Theresa May as a \u201cdouble-lock\u201d \u2013 is a compromise between three different recommendations. Parliament\u2019s intelligence and security commission said that authorisation should remain with ministers. Anderson said the job should be given to judges. A report from the Royal United Services Institute came closest to recommending the hybrid model that the government has chosen. The process will start with a secretary of state. Before issuing a targeted interception warrant or a targeted examination warrant, the minister will need the approval of a judicial commissioner. In an urgent case, the warrant may be issued by a designated senior official alone and approved later by a judicial commissioner. Without that approval, the warrant will lapse and the commissioner may order the destruction of intercepted material. If the judicial commissioner refuses to issue the warrant, the minister will be able to appeal to the IP commissioner. If the IP commissioner refuses to grant approval, there would have to be a process of discussion and compromise.\nAs always, though, the devil is in the detail. It will be for the judicial commissioner to decide whether the warrant is necessary and proportionate. \u201cNecessary\u201d means that it is needed in the interests of national security, for the purpose of preventing or detecting serious crime, in the interests of the UK\u2019s economic wellbeing or in support of an EU mutual assistance agreement. In deciding whether the warrant meets those requirements, the \u201cjudicial commissioner must apply the same principles as would be applied by a court on an application for judicial review\u201d. That suggests the commissioner would look more closely at the decision-making process than at the decision itself. Judges are used to being called in by ministers to conduct inquiries when public things have gone wrong. This is the first example of a judge being recruited by the government to reassure us that private things are being done right. Judicial oversight will go down well with European courts and foreign governments. But it is essential to ensure that it is not abused by commissioners being misled or kept in the dark. To do so would damage not only the judicial commissioners, who will be working for the government \u2013 it would also damage public confidence in the judiciary as a whole.\n",

        "body": "We now have the technology to abolish privacy altogether. A competent policeman could solve almost any crime if given a complete record of all the data collected by our phones, the computers that we use at desks all day, and, soon, the innumerable household devices that monitor and report to central servers their and their users\u2019 operation, the coming wave of health monitoring devices and even Britain\u2019s unparalleled network of CCTV monitors. The data would show where we had been, how we had got there, who we had met, what we had asked search engines, who we had talked to \u2013 and whether we had taken any measures to hide any of this. All that would be available without tapping a single phone call. To some people, and the home secretary may be one of them, this looks like an ideal state. But the concentration of such power would inevitably lead to its abuse \u2013 and in new and horrible ways. If information is power, complete information will tend to corrupt completely. The state that held all that knowledge in its hands would turn into a tyranny. Almost as dangerously, much of it\u00a0would leak out to criminals. What keeps this nightmare at bay is two things. The first, and most important, is that the information is not all held centrally. In fact much of it, like the content of emails that\u00a0Google scans in order to display ads alongside them, is never read by human eyes at all. The second restraining factor is the law and that is less of a protection just when we need it to be more of one. The present laws governing government surveillance are \u2013 everyone agrees \u2013 a tattered and outdated patchwork. The problem is that Theresa May\u2019s proposed replacement puts in place of the old patchwork something much more like\u00a0a fishnet \u2013 wonderfully flexible but made\u00a0up mostly of holes. All three parliamentary committees that have examined her proposals have criticised them. The powers she demands are uncosted, unjustified and very probably unworkable. Two aspects are particularly conspicuous and vulnerable to criticism. The first is the demand that phone companies and internet service providers keep records of all connections made through them going back for a year. If it were to be effective, it would have to cover all public Wi-Fi networks, including those in cafes and libraries. This represents such a huge amount of data that no one knows whether it would even be technically feasible to collect. What is certain is that even the attempt would cost many times what the Home Office presently forecasts \u2013 the official estimate is around \u00a3150m. If this is like any other government computing project, it would easily end up costing 10 times as much before it is abandoned as not working. The second warning flag is Mrs May\u2019s insistence that the new powers would be \u201ctechnologically neutral\u201d. That\u2019s impossible. The interplay between technology and privacy is one of constant change. Privacy is a legal and social construct while technology develops to its own quite independent laws. Without a clear and concise statement of the principles on which the law is supposed to operate, her draft bill is no more than 300 pages of misleading detail. It needs to be rewritten. It needs realistic costing. And it will need to be revisited in five years\u2019 time when there will be fresh threats and challenges from ubiquitous technology.\n",

        "body": "Plans to grant police and intelligence officers new powers to monitor suspects online will not get through parliament without a requirement for judges to sign off on spying warrants, the former Conservative shadow home secretary David Davis has said. The backbench MP was speaking before the publication of a draft of the investigatory powers bill, due on Wednesday, with the Home Office so far refusing to indicate whether the proposed legislation will include judicial approval of applications made by the security services to intercept communications. Speaking on BBC1\u2019s Sunday Politics show, Davis said: \u201cActually I don\u2019t think this bill will get through either Commons or Lords without judicial authorisation \u2026 There\u2019s a new consensus on this right across the board \u2013 across the experts, across the spooks, across the parties, across both houses of parliament.\u201d\nDavis, who has campaigned with Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, against what they see as draconian surveillance legislation, denied that a system requiring judicial approval would be less accountable. \u201cEvery time I\u2019ve asked a question of any minister on a security matter \u2026 they say \u2018we don\u2019t comment on security matters.\u2019 There is no accountability.\u201d The Home Office has already said that it has dropped several contentious proposals from the bill, including plans to allow the police and security services full access to everyone\u2019s internet browsing history. The climbdown was prompted by concerns that the government would be unable to get the legislation through parliament because of unease of its implications for civil liberties. A report published in June by David Anderson QC recommended that judicial rather than ministerial authorisation of individual, targeted intercept warrants should be required. His position runs counter to parliament\u2019s intelligence and security committee, which said in March that responsibility should remain with ministers. The Royal United Services Institute favours an approach under which government authorises some warrants and judges others.\nSpeaking on BBC1\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, the home secretary, Theresa May, said she sets time aside every day to consider such warrants. \u201cI will be explaining the government\u2019s position to parliament this week,\u201d she said. Davis said: \u201cAt the moment, the home secretary does about 10 of these warrants in a working day. It\u2019s impossible for any one person to do this. It\u2019s bad practice, it\u2019s bad managerially, it\u2019s bad legally and it\u2019s bad in terms of counter-terrorism.\u201d Speaking to on the Murnaghan programme on Sky News, the former Liberal Democrat leader Lord Ashdown said the upper house would ensure that judicial oversight of warrants was added to the bill if it was not included in the draft. \u201cThis is precisely constitutionally the kind of bill within which we should be intervening if indeed the legislation is deficient,\u201dhe said. The shadow home secretary, Andy Burnham, said on Thursday that Labour would not support the investigatory powers bill unless it included judicial oversight of national security warrants. A spokesperson for Burnham said the shadow cabinet had agreed the party\u2019s position, including the opposition leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and his deputy, Tom Watson, who both voted against the current emergency legislation. Speaking on BBC1\u2019s Sunday Politics programme, the shadow home office minister, Keir Starmer, a former director of public prosecutions, said judicial authorisation of new intercept powers was a red line for Labour.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got the chance to have a modern comprehensive law that sets out the powers for law enforcement and the security services and, at the same time, we\u2019ve got the chance - a historic chance - to get the safeguards right. And one of the safeguards that\u2019s really important is judicial authorisation of intercept warrants,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between data and content, and by content we mean what are people actually saying to each other. That should be signed off by a judge. That\u2019s what happens in other countries.\u201d The Sun reported on Thursday that the attorney general, Jeremy Wright, had advised May against giving judges oversight. A minister told the paper: \u201cThe attorney general\u2019s advice was very clear. It would be totally irresponsible of government to allow the legal system to dictate to us on matters as important as terrorism. Not only would they tie things in knots very quickly, but they are not elected and answerable to nobody.\u201d\n",

        "body": "A bill giving the UK intelligence agencies and police the most sweeping surveillance powers in the western world has passed into law with barely a whimper, meeting only token resistance over the past 12 months from inside parliament and barely any from outside. The Investigatory Powers Act, passed on Thursday, legalises a whole range of tools for snooping and hacking by the security services unmatched by any other country in western Europe or even the US. The security agencies and police began the year braced for at least some opposition, rehearsing arguments for the debate. In the end, faced with public apathy and an opposition in disarray, the government did not have to make a single substantial concession to the privacy lobby. US whistleblower Edward Snowden tweeted: \u201cThe UK has just legalised the most extreme surveillance in the history of western democracy. It goes further than many autocracies.\u201d Snowden in 2013 revealed the scale of mass surveillance \u2013 or bulk data collection as the security agencies prefer to describe it \u2013 by the US National Security Agency and the UK\u2019s GCHQ, which work in tandem. But, against a backdrop of fears of Islamist attacks, the privacy lobby has failed to make much headway. Even in Germany, with East Germany\u2019s history of mass surveillance by the Stasi and where Snowden\u2019s revelations produced the most outcry, the Bundestag recently passed legislation giving the intelligence agencies more surveillance powers. The US passed a modest bill last year curtailing bulk phone data collection but the victory of Donald Trump in the US presidential election is potentially a major reverse for privacy advocates. On the campaign trail, Trump made comments that implied he would like to use the powers of the surveillance agencies against political opponents. The Liberal Democrat peer Lord Strasburger, one of the leading voices against the investigatory powers bill, said: \u201cWe do have to worry about a UK Donald Trump. If we do end up with one, and that is not impossible, we have created the tools for repression. If Labour had backed us up, we could have made the bill better. We have ended up with a bad bill because they were all over the place. \u201cThe real Donald Trump has access to all the data that the British spooks are gathering and we should be worried about that.\u201d The Investigatory Powers Act legalises powers that the security agencies and police had been using for years without making this clear to either the public or parliament. In October, the investigatory powers tribunal, the only court that hears complaints against MI6, MI5 and GCHQ, ruled that they had been unlawfully collecting massive volumes of confidential personal data without proper oversight for 17 years. One of the negative aspects of the legislation is that it fails to provide adequate protection for journalists\u2019 sources, which could discourage whistleblowing. One of the few positives in the legislation is that it sets out clearly for the first time the surveillance powers available to the intelligence services and the police. It legalises hacking by the security agencies into computers and mobile phones and allows them access to masses of stored personal data, even if the person under scrutiny is not suspected of any wrongdoing. Privacy groups are challenging the surveillance powers in the European court of human rights and elsewhere. Jim Killock, the executive director of Open Rights Group, said: \u201cThe UK now has a surveillance law that is more suited to a dictatorship than a democracy. The state has unprecedented powers to monitor and analyse UK citizens\u2019 communications regardless of whether we are suspected of any criminal activity.\u201d Renate Samson, the chief executive of Big Brother Watch, said: \u201cThe passing of the investigatory powers bill has fundamentally changed the face of surveillance in this country. None of us online are now guaranteed the right to communicate privately and, most importantly, securely.\u201d Trump\u2019s victory started speculation that, given his warm words for Vladimir Putin, he might do a deal with the Russian president to have Snowden sent back to the US where he faces a long jail sentence. Snowden has lived in Russia since leaking tens of thousands of documents to journalists in 2013. But Bill Binney, a former member of the NSA who became a whistleblower, expressed scepticism: \u201cI am not sure if the relationship a President Trump would have with President Putin would be bad for Snowden. \u201cIn Russia, he would still be an asset that maybe Putin would use in bargaining with Trump. Otherwise, Snowden does have a large support network around the world plus in the US and Trump may not want to disturb that. Also, I think any move to get Snowden out of Russia and into US courts would also open up support for at least three other lawsuits against the US government\u2019s unconstitutional surveillance.\u201d This article was amended on 19 November 2016. The act has not yet received royal assent, as stated in an earlier version.\n",

        "body": "Labour has signalled it is prepared to oppose new surveillance and counter-terrorism legislation if it is too heavy-handed, as David Cameron announces more details about his anti-terror strategy such as measures to prevent teenagers travelling to join Isis. Andy Burnham, the shadow home secretary, said Labour will support legislation that is \u201creasonable and proportionate\u201d but stressed the party had a duty to make sure the government gets the balance right. He warned Cameron to proceed with the utmost caution and make sure his laws do not fuel \u201cresentment, division and a sense of victimisation\u201d, especially among Britain\u2019s Muslim population. Cameron is planning to spell out more details of his strategy on Monday, as well as making the case for two new pieces of law \u2013 the investigatory powers bill and a counter-terrorism bill. As part of the overall strategy, he will extend the powers of parents to cancel their children\u2019s passports if they are worried that their children may be about to travel to Syria or Iraq to join Islamic State. The powers that currently apply to under-16s will now be rolled out to all those under-18. There will also be new measures to automatically bar convicted terrorists from working with children and vulnerable people. Cameron will also announce that suspected jihadi returning from Syria and Iraq will be forced to attend classes to address their support for extremist ideology. \u201cWe know that extremism is really a symptom. Ideology is the root cause. But the stakes are rising and that demands a new approach. So we have a choice \u2013 do we choose to turn a blind eye or do we choose to get out there and make the case for our British values,\u201d Cameron will say. \u201cThe government\u2019s new counter-extremism strategy is a clear signal of the choice we have made to take on this poisonous ideology with resolve, determination and the goal of a building a greater Britain.\u201d The new anti-extremism bill will force public sector organisations to boycott gorups or individuals listed as extremist, introduce \u201cextremism disruption orders\u201d on those seeking to radicalise young people online, close mosques where extremist meetings have taken place and strengthen the powers available to the media regulator to sanction channels that broadcast extremist content. Separately, the investigatory powers bill is expected to strengthen the surveillance powers of the authorities and is expected to go beyond the communications data bill \u2013 nicknamed the snooper\u2019s charter \u2013 which was blocked in the last parliament by the Liberal Democrats. As well as enabling the tracking of internet and social media use, the legislation will also move to strengthen the security services\u2019 warranted powers for the bulk interception of the content of communications. In response, Burnham indicated the government could not necessarily rely on Labour\u2019s support for his anti-terror strategy. He said: \u201cThis is the greatest challenge of our age and the prime minister is right to devote his focus to it. For our part, we will always support measures that are reasonable, proportionate and evidence-based. But we have a job to ensure that, in this difficult area, the government gets the balance right and doesn\u2019t go beyond that. \u201cThis summer, David Cameron failed to strike that balance by implying that the whole Muslim community \u2018quietly condones\u2019 extremism. He should use today\u2019s speech to correct that suggestion and set the right context for the difficult decisions that lie ahead. He should be building bridges with the Muslim community not destroying them. \u201cAs [Tory MP] David Davis warns, the PM needs to take care to make sure the measures are not heavy-handed. If he\u2019s not careful, they could have the opposite effect and fuel resentment, division and a sense of victimisation. The government must proceed with the utmost caution and Labour will watch carefully to ensure the correct balance is achieved.\u201d Burnham\u2019s comments are important because the government\u2019s previous attempts to pass surveillance legislation - the communications data bill - failed when the Lib Dems and up to 40 Tory rebels indicated they considered it too extreme. Labour\u2019s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, and its deputy leader, Tom Watson, are known for their strong campaigning record on civil liberties in contrast to the stance of the last Labour governments.\n",

        "body": "Privacy activists, human rights campaigners and former US security officials have expressed fears over the prospect of Donald Trump controlling the vast global US and UK surveillance network. They criticised Barack Obama\u2019s administration for being too complacent after the 2013 revelations by the NSA whistleblower, Edward Snowden, and making only modest concessions to privacy concerns rather than carrying out major legislative changes. The concern comes after Snowden dismissed fears for his safety if Trump, who called him \u201ca spy who has caused great damage in the US\u201d, was to strike a deal with Vladimir Putin to have him extradited. Snowden, in a video link-up from Moscow with a Netherlands-based tech company on Thursday, said it would be \u201ccrazy to dismiss\u201d the prospect of Trump doing a deal but if personal safety was a major concern for him, he would not have leaked the top-secret documents in the first place. Snowden, wanted by the US on charges under the Espionage Act, found asylum in Russia in 2013 but his visa is due to expire in July. Privacy and human rights campaigners in the US and UK say a Trump presidency will tip the balance between surveillance and privacy decisively towards the former. The UK surveillance agency GCHQ is so tied up with America\u2019s NSA, often doing work on its behalf, it could find itself facing a series of ethical dilemmas. On the campaign trail, Trump made an ambiguous remark about wishing he had access to surveillance powers. \u201cI wish I had that power,\u201d he said while talking about the hack of Democratic National Committee emails. \u201cMan, that would be power.\u201d Although Obama\u2019s administration introduced a few modest concessions to the privacy lobby following Snowden\u2019s revelations, he left the rest of the surveillance apparatus untouched. His approach has been to offer a modicum of transparency, much of it forced on him by the courts, in place of reform.\nThe White House, which would not comment for this story, has no evident regrets about that approach. The administration believes it has set an appropriate balance between intelligence authorities and civil liberties, and expressed confidence in intelligence professionals who will continue to serve in the NSA and FBI under Trump to act responsibly. But others are less convinced. \u201cThere have been some people who were complacent about things like drone killing of US civilians and mass surveillance under Obama, because they trusted him. That wilful neglect on their part is about to come back and possibly bite all of us in the ass,\u201d said Nick Merrill, the executive director of the Calyx Institute, a technology focused research group that promotes encryption tools. Ben Wizner, Snowden\u2019s lawyer who works for the American Civil Liberties Union, said: \u201cThe danger of the aggregation of executive power we have seen over the last decade is that we might have an executive who is not worthy of that trust. This has been a trend in the US but there has been a weakening of constitutional oversight during the growth of the national security state. \u201cI think many Americans are waking up to the fact we have created a presidency that is too powerful.\u201d John Napier Tye, a former state department official who became a reluctant whistleblower in 2014, warning of NSA dragnets, said: \u201cObama and Bush could have set the best possible privacy protections in place, but the trouble is, it\u2019s all set by executive order, not statute. \u201cSo Trump could revise the executive order as he pleases. And since it\u2019s all done in secret, unless you have someone willing to break the law to tell you that it happened, it\u2019s not clear the public will ever learn it did. Consider that even now, the American people still do not know how much data on US persons the NSA actually collects.\u201d Thomas Drake, an NSA whistleblower who predated Snowden, offered an equally bleak assessment. He said: \u201cThe electronic infrastructure is fully in place \u2013 and ex post facto legalised by Congress and executive orders \u2013 and ripe for further abuse under an autocratic, power-obsessed president. History is just not kind here. Trump leans quite autocratic. The temptations to use secret NSA surveillance powers, some still not fully revealed, will present themselves to him as sirens.\u201d One specific surveillance measure Trump proposed on the campaign trail was surveilling mosques and keeping a database of Muslims. \u201cA grave concern we have is that his rhetoric is going to be perceived in some corners as a green light for unfettered surveillance activities. Our concern is not just about the NSA but also the FBI. The FBI doesn\u2019t exactly have a great record over the last 15 years,\u201d said Farhana Khera, the president and executive director of the US-based civil rights group Muslim Advocates. The next flashpoint over the NSA\u2019s powers will come late in 2017, when a major surveillance law permitting collection of Americans\u2019 international communications is set for expiration, the legal basis for the NSA\u2019s Prism programme which siphons information from the technology giants.\nThe UK government has made even fewer concessions to privacy campaigners than the US. The UK parliament has passed the investigatory powers bill, due to receive royal assent shortly, that basically legalises the illegal activities exposed by Snowden. Even in Germany, where public support for Snowden is at its highest, parliament last month approved legislation that ostensibly increases oversight of intelligence agencies but which privacy campaigners claim expands their powers. Jim Killock, executive director of the UK-based Open Rights Group, said the NSA and GCHQ worked closely together. \u201cGiven that the agencies\u2019 operations are nearly indistinguishable, it makes it incredibly hard for the UK to resist using our resources for risky endeavours or even human rights abuses \u2026 Trump\u2019s election ought to remove the complacency MPs have been suffering from.\u201d Carly Nyst, a UK-based human rights lawyer, said: \u201cThe British people should be especially worried: the NSA and GCHQ act so closely, and intelligence is shared so fulsomely, that any increase in surveillance under Trump will undeniably touch upon the privacy of Britons\u2019 communications.\u201d According to documents released by Snowden, now years out of date as technological advancements have developed, the NSA vacuums 5bn daily records just of cellphone locations. In April 2011, it was collecting an average of 194m text messages every day. Through its partnership with Britain\u2019s GCHQ, it has access to, among other things, webcam imagery, including pornographic material. GCHQ collected such imagery from 1.8 million Yahoo users in a six-month period in 2008.\n",

        "body": "A judge has rejected the settlement of a lawsuit triggered by the New York City police department\u2019s surveillance of Muslims, on the grounds that the terms did not go far enough. The settlement ruled upon was a January resolution of two cases, which stem from 2011 revelations that the NYPD was conducting widespread surveillance of Muslims that plaintiffs argued had violated their rights. January\u2019s settlement resulted in Mayor Bill De Blasio agreeing to appoint a civilian monitor of the NYPD\u2019s counter-terrorism units, pending approval by a judge. The presiding judge in the case, Charles S Haight Jr, agreed with the overall structure of the settlement but found that the powers of the civilian representative agreed upon in the settlement did not go far enough. \u201cThe proposed role and powers of the civilian representative do not furnish sufficient protection from potential violations of the constitutional rights of those law-abiding Muslims and believers in Islam who live, move and have their being in this city,\u201d Haight wrote in his ruling. This means that a new settlement will have to be negotiated by the parties involved or take the matter to court. Haight\u2019s main contention in the negotiated settlement was the power and appointment of the civilian representative. The settlement stipulates the representative should report violations to the police commissioner, who is only obligated to investigate the incident, but Haight argued the representative should rather file quarterly reports to the court. He also rejected provisions that the mayor should appoint the civilian representative and have the power to eliminate the position after five years. The lawsuits arose following 2011 revelations that the NYPD, with help from the CIA, was using undercover informants to spy on Muslims throughout New York and New Jersey in mosques, religious bookstores, hookah bars and other places. In his ruling, Haight also cited a recent report by the NYPD\u2019s inspector general, an oversight body. The report examined the compliance by the department\u2019s intelligence unit of the Handschu guidelines \u2013 a set of provisions designed to ensure the NYPD does not overreach when investigating political or religious groups. The report found the department has consistently violated several regulations by continuing investigations and using informants for extended periods without authorization. The report also highlighted in a footnote that 95% of investigations were launched against Muslims. According to some watchdog groups and the OIG report, NYPD\u2019s targeting of Muslims has continued despite the disbanding of the demographics unit, which was created in the wake of 9/11 and focused on monitoring Muslim communities. The judge said the report described a near systematic failure on the NYPD\u2019s to comply with these particular guidelines. NYPD officials characterized the report findings as vindication that they were complying with guidelines. Haight was also the judge who ruled in favor of expanding the NYPD\u2019s powers to allow it to act with less oversight post-9/11. The plaintiffs in the cases are represented by several civil liberties groups, including the ACLU and the New York Civil Liberties Union, all of which received Haight\u2019s ruling positively. \u201cThe ruling is an opportunity to put stronger safeguards in place and we very much look forward to discussing the court\u2019s suggestions with the NYPD and with the city,\u201d said Ramzi Kassem, a law professor at CUNY School of Law, where he directs the Clear project. \u201cBecause we believe that this is in the interest of all New Yorkers, we hope that the reforms are implemented as soon as possible.\u201d The city law spokesman Nick Paolucci said they were disappointed the settlement was not approved. \u201cTo the extent that the Court\u2019s decision is based in part on an Inspector General\u2019s report containing findings with which both the City and Class Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel variously disagree, we are disappointed that the settlement was not approved as the parties originally proposed,\u201d Paolucci said in a statement. \u201cThat said, we will explore ways to address the concerns raised by the Judge.\u201d Fahd Ahmed, executive director of Desis Rising Up & Moving, whose group has documented the ongoing surveillance by NYPD, said that even with the judge\u2019s suggestions, the settlement does not go far enough as it largely depends on good faith from the police department which they have not earned. \u201cAs the judge points out, and the inspector general report confirms, the NYPD has a long history of ignoring rules and disregarding court orders and their own procedures,\u201d Ahmed said.\n",

        "body": "The White House has admitted that Donald Trump does not know what type of surveillance he is alleging he was put under by Barack Obama, despite a tweet on Saturday explicitly saying his phone was tapped. Sean Spicer, the president\u2019s press secretary, argued that there was \u201csubstantial reporting\u201d to show the issue merited congressional investigation, but did not identify Trump\u2019s sources. Trump alleged, without citing evidence, that Obama ordered a wiretap of the phones at Trump\u2019s election campaign headquarters in Trump Tower in New York. \u201cHow low has President Obama gone to tapp [sic] my phones during the very sacred election process,\u201d he tweeted early on Saturday morning. \u201cThis is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!\u201d\nPrevious media reports have suggested that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (Fisa) court granted a warrant to enable the FBI to conduct surveillance of \u201cUS persons\u201d in an investigation of possible contacts between Russian banks and the Trump Organization. The Guardian reported that the FBI applied for a Fisa warrant over the summer in order to monitor four members of the Trump team suspected of irregular contacts with Russian officials. The Fisa court turned down the application asking FBI counter-intelligence investigators to narrow its focus. According to one report, the FBI was finally granted a warrant in October, but that has not been confirmed, and it is not clear whether any warrant led to a full investigation. On Sunday, Obama\u2019s director of national intelligence, James Clapper, denied any such court order was obtained. But Spicer told reporters on Monday: \u201cIt could be Fisa, it could be surveillance. I think he\u2019s [Trump] made clear that there are continued reports that have been out there. I think the president made it clear yesterday that he wants Congress to go in and look at this. I think there is substantial reporting out there from individuals and from sources.\u201d The White House asked the Republican-led Congress to examine, as part of an ongoing investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in last November\u2019s election, whether the Obama administration abused its authority. But Spicer admitted he could not be more specific about what the abuse might have been. \u201cI think that there\u2019s no question that something happened. The question is, is it surveillance, is it a wiretap, or whatever? \u201cBut there has been enough reporting that strongly suggests that something occurred and I think that\u2019s why what he has said yesterday is that he wants Congress to look into this. And I think that there is enough out there now that makes one wonder how some of this happened without the existence of surveillance.\u201d A journalist attempted to press the issue further but Spicer interrupted him and said: \u201cI\u2019m going to put a pin in this.\u201d He added later: \u201cThe president speaks very candidly. His tweets speak for themselves.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s early Saturday morning tweets \u2013 an extraordinary charge by an incumbent president against a predecessor \u2013 came shortly after similar claims were made by a conservative radio host, later summarised by the rightwing Breitbart News. Pressed specifically on whether Trump based his accusations on a radio host, Spicer said: \u201cHe is not going to comment any further on this,\u201d but added there were \u201cnumerous\u201d reports, including one in the New York Times and \u201cseveral sources brought this to light\u201d. Minutes earlier Spicer had railed against the media for basing reports about possible contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia on anonymous sources. \u201cAt some point I would ask people to take on-the-record sources.\u201d Trump would also ask Congress to look into the issue of \u201cpervasive leaks\u201d of classified information relating to national security, he added. Asked if Trump had spoken to Obama before making the accusation, or indeed whether he had spoken to Obama since moving into the Oval Office, Spicer replied: \u201cI\u2019m not aware of whether or not they\u2019ve talked. I can ask and get back to you.\u201d James Comey, the director of the FBI, asked the justice department to reject the president\u2019s assertion because it was false and must be corrected, according to the New York Times and other media reports. The department has remained silent. Spicer was questioned over whether Trump had spoken to Comey. \u201cTo the best of my knowledge, I\u2019m almost 100% certain he has not,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not aware that actually happened.\u201d Leading Republicans have said they will honour the president\u2019s request to investigate but conceded that they were not aware of any evidence for the president\u2019s assertion. On Monday, Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House oversight and government reform committee, told CBS: \u201cThus far, I have not seen anything directly that would support what the president has said.\u201d\nChaffetz added that it would take time for a House intelligence panel investigating the alleged Russia links to get to the bottom of the wiretapping allegation and that his committee would play a supporting role in this. Meanwhile, Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader in the Senate, called on the Department of Justice\u2019s inspector general to investigate any possible political interference in its inquiries into contacts between Trump\u2019s associates and Russia. \u201cThe American people deserve to know if the investigation into Russia\u2019s interference with our election and the administration\u2019s contact with Russian officials has been compromised by political interference,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cAs we saw last week \u2013 when attorney general Sessions only decided to recuse himself after his misleading Congress regarding Russia contacts became public \u2013 this administration has not been forthcoming about its contacts with Russia, and are too slow to follow DoJ guidelines designed to ensure investigations are fair and independent.\u201d Schumer added: \u201cWe need to ensure that the investigation is impartial, and hasn\u2019t already been compromised in any way by the Trump administration. That\u2019s why I\u2019m calling on the inspector general to get involved immediately.\u201d Fellow Democrat Nancy Pelosi, minority leader in the House, has accused Trump of behaving like an autocrat. \u201cIt\u2019s called a wrap-up smear,\u201d she said. \u201cYou make up something. Then you have the press write about it. And then you say, everybody is writing about this charge. It\u2019s a tool of an authoritarian.\u201d\n",
