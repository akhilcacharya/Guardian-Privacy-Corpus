[{"date": "2016-10-03T17:20:11Z", "body": "About 95 tonnes of oil have been leaked into the North Sea from a BP platform, the company has said. The leak is about two and a half times smaller than the biggest North Sea spill in recent years, at Shell\u2019s Gannet platform off Aberdeen in 2011. The spill from the Clair platform is being monitored from the air by plane which, combined with modelling, shows the oil moving away from land in a northerly direction. \u201cThe most recent surveillance flight already indicates significant dispersal of the oil at the surface,\u201d the company said in a statement.\nThe platform, 46 miles (75km) west of Shetland, was shut down following the spill on Sunday at about 10am. The leak was caused by a technical issue with a system designed to separate the mixed production fluids of water, oil and gas, the company said following an investigation. BP believes that allowing the oil to disperse naturally at sea is the best way to deal with the spill, although other options have not been ruled out. In a statement, it said: \u201cThe release was stopped within an hour once the issue had been identified and Clair production was taken offline.\u201d Oil spill and environmental experts from BP, Oil Spill Response Limited and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy are said to have been working to assess any potential impact of the spill on the environment. A spokesman for RSPB Scotland said: \u201cThere are currently many sensitive seabird species dispersing from their breeding colonies on Shetland and Norway out into the Atlantic, and these are potentially at risk. We need to know from BP and the maritime agencies exactly what type of oil has been spilled, if it is breaking up in the water column, and what the statutory conservation agencies are advising. \u201cIt is critical that there is a full and open report of what has happened, with assurances that the situation will be monitored, and details of seabird concentrations in the vicinity revealed as soon as possible.\u201d\n", "title": "BP platform leaks 95 tonnes of oil into North Sea"}, {"date": "2017-03-06T18:01:15Z", "body": "One of the oddities in Donald Trump\u2019s wiretapping claims is how antiquated is his view of how the security services work in the digital age.\nIn tweets on Saturday, the president claimed that Barack Obama had ordered a wiretap of Trump Tower in October ahead of November\u2019s election. \u201cHow low has President gone to tapp [sic] my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!\u201d Trump\u2019s tweets suggest he is stuck is a cold-war time warp, with spies still using the kind of techniques found in John le Carr\u00e9 novels rather than 21st-century surveillance. The US security agencies \u2013 whether the FBI, CIA or one of a dozen others \u2013 no longer have to engage in wiretapping of the kind that Trump hints at. Until a decade or so ago, a wiretap meant connecting to a target\u2019s landline or placing bugs in a house. Security staff might have to break in during the night or turn up during the day pretending to be cleaners or phone engineers, placing bugs directly into phones or under tables or hiding miniature cameras in light fittings. For the security services, old-fashioned phone-tapping operations were risky. A bug might be found. A suspicious click might be heard during a phone conversation, alerting the target. And there was always the danger of being caught \u2013 as during the Watergate scandal, which Trump referred to in one of his tweets. In 1972 burglars working on behalf of president Richard Nixon\u2019s re-election campaign broke into the Democratic party headquarters in Washington, and successfully installed a listening device on at least one phone. Things went wrong when they decided they had to break in a second time to carry out repairs and were caught.\nBut there is no need for such risks these days. As this week\u2019s Wikileaks CIA dump confirmed, the past two decades have been a golden age for the security services, courtesy of the digital revolution. There would have been no need to break into Trump Tower. The security agencies can access electronic devices across the planet with ease. They can listen in to a target\u2019s mobile, even if it is switched off. If the target is paranoid and stuffs the mobile into a microwave or fridge freezer to render it inert, the security services can pick up the target\u2019s conversations by switching to the mobiles of others in the vicinity. The standout detail from the latest leak is that the CIA had a programme called Weeping Angel which described how to attack a Samsung F8000 TV set so that it appears to be off but could still be used for monitoring.\nThey can access just about anyone\u2019s computer or laptop, again even those that are turned off. The same for cameras on computers and laptops, which can also be switched on remotely. The technology to turn on smart phones remotely has been around for at least a decade. A former CIA cyber-security specialist has explained how the security services can set up a cell network tower and, once a phone connects, they can take it over. They can mimic the process of the phone closing down and make it appear blank, whereas, in reality, a mic remains live. A former FBI specialist has said that the ability to use cameras on computers and laptops has also been available for at least a decade. The security services can use malware to take control of the camera, ensuring there is no light or any other indication that would allow a person to know they are being watched. Who needs wiretaps when there are so many potential listening devices around these days? Even the word \u201cwiretap\u201d is antiquated. The security services and privacy advocates are more likely now to talk about \u201cinterception\u201d, a more accurate description of what they do. Trump has offered no evidence to back up his claim. The recently retired director of national intelligence James Clapper said the Obama-ordered wiretapping did not happen, though Clapper is an unreliable witness, having misled Congress in 2013 by stating there was no mass surveillance in the US. FBI director James Comey also denies the claim but Comey, too, is tainted, given his late intervention in the election race with damaging comments about Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. Denials from Obama\u2019s own national security team are more credible, not least because \u2013 though a president enjoys sweeping powers \u2013 he cannot order the security services to mount the kind of operation Trump has in mind.\nWiretaps are as old as electronic communications. The telegraph began to come into use in the 1840s. Almost two decades later, during the American civil war, it became commonplace for both sides to climb telegraph poles and tap into communications. Abraham Lincoln, in spite of nods towards privacy, was an avid reader of intercepted communications. The arrival of the phone in the 1870s offered new opportunities. Throughout the 20th century, police regularly used wiretaps to trap criminals, while the intelligence services targeted those who were deemed to be threats to national security. During the cold war, diplomats as a matter of routine assumed their phones were tapped and their offices bugged, and not just Americans based in Moscow or Beijing, but all around the world. CIA officers based in embassies almost always had a safe room that had been swept for bugs and where sensitive conversations could be held in relative security. While the Watergate conspiracy is the most infamous US case involving wiretapping and politics, equally infamous is the list of operations conducted in the 1960s and 1970s by the CIA and FBI. The targets included prominent individuals seen as potentially undermining national security, including anti-Vietnam war protesters, trade unionists and journalists.\nAmong those was Martin Luther King, who the head of the FBI, Edgar Hoover, suspected of being influenced by communists. Hoover asked the then attorney-general Robert Kennedy in 1963 to authorise surveillance requests to install bugs in his home, office and hotels where he stayed on trips. No evidence ever emerged linking King to communism, but they did record at least one sexual encounter. Throughout the 20th century there were intermittent challenges in Congress and the courts attempting to redress the balance between intrusive surveillance and the right to privacy. Amid the panic in the Bush administration in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, the president secretly sanctioned \u201cwarrantless wiretapping\u201d \u2013 surveillance of phones, the internet and any other electronic communications without the need for a warrant. When this was revealed in the New York Times in 2005, the Bush administration reversed the order and there was a return to warrants. This row was dwarfed in 2013 when the National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed the scale of mass surveillance \u2013 the agencies prefer bulk data collection \u2013 not only of foreigners but of US citizens, which the intelligence agencies had publicly denied up until that point. Among the many intercept programmes revealed by Snowden was Tempora, run by the NSA\u2019s UK counterpart GCHQ, and shared with the Americans. This was a kind of wiretap on a scale that would have been beyond the imagination of the American civil war soldiers who climbed telegraph poles, or the FBI agents breaking into King\u2019s hotel room to plant a bug. GCHQ placed intercepts on the network of fibre-optic cables that carry much of the world\u2019s internet traffic, offering a window into the world of an estimated two billion users of the worldwide web. The US intelligence agencies have so far made a distinction when denying surveillance of Trump. There have been no denials about surveillance of those associates who might have been in contact with Russians. Those kind of contacts would be relatively easy to establish, not through break-ins or even physical surveillance \u2013 which has not been made redundant by the digital age, with agencies running teams trained in following targets without, hopefully, being seen. With so much information hoovered up and available to the agencies, all they have to do is sift through those communications to establish the extent \u2013 if any \u2013 of links between Russia and Trump\u2019s team.\n", "title": "Trump\u2019s wiretap paranoia and the reality of modern surveillance"}, {"date": "2017-03-07T16:42:15Z", "body": "The US intelligence agencies are facing fresh embarrassment after WikiLeaks published what it described as the biggest ever leak of confidential documents from the CIA detailing the tools it uses to break into phones, communication apps and other electronic devices. The thousands of leaked documents focus mainly on techniques for hacking and reveal how the CIA cooperated with British intelligence to engineer a way to compromise smart televisions and turn them into improvised surveillance devices. The leak, named \u201cVault 7\u201d by WikiLeaks, will once again raise questions about the inability of US spy agencies to protect secret documents in the digital age. It follows disclosures about Afghanistan and Iraq by army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning in 2010 and about the National Security Agency and Britain\u2019s GCHQ by Edward Snowden in 2013.\nThe new documents appear to be from the CIA\u2019s 200-strong Center for Cyber Intelligence and show in detail how the agency\u2019s digital specialists engage in hacking. Monday\u2019s leak of about 9,000 secret files, which WikiLeaks said was only the first tranche of documents it had obtained, were all relatively recent, running from 2013 to 2016. The revelations in the documents include: CIA hackers targeted smartphones and computers. The Center for Cyber Intelligence, based at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, has a second covert base in the US consulate in Frankfurt which covers Europe, the Middle East and Africa. A programme called Weeping Angel describes how to attack a Samsung F8000 TV set so that it appears to be off but can still be used for monitoring. The CIA declined to comment on the leak beyond the agency\u2019s now-stock refusal to verify the content. \u201cWe do not comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents,\u201d wrote CIA spokesperson Heather Fritz Horniak. But it is understood the documents are genuine and a hunt is under way for the leakers or hackers responsible for the leak. WikiLeaks, in a statement, was vague about its source. \u201cThe archive appears to have been circulated among former US government hackers and contractors in an unauthorised manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive,\u201d the organisation said. The leak feeds into the present feverish controversy in Washington over alleged links between Donald Trump\u2019s team and Russia. US officials have claimed WikiLeaks acts as a conduit for Russian intelligence and Trump sided with the website during the White House election campaign, praising the organisation for publishing leaked Hillary Clinton emails. Asked about the claims regarding vulnerabilities in consumer products, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to comment on that. Obviously that\u2019s something that\u2019s not been fully evaluated.\u201d Asked about Trump\u2019s praise for WikiLeaks during last year\u2019s election, when it published emails hacked from Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, Spicer told the Guardian: \u201cThe president said there\u2019s a difference between Gmail accounts and classified information. The president made that distinction a couple of weeks ago.\u201d Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks editor-in-chief, said the disclosures were \u201cexceptional from a political, legal and forensic perspective\u201d. WikiLeaks has been criticised in the past for dumping documents on the internet unredacted and this time the names of officials and other information have been blacked out. WikiLeaks shared the information in advance with Der Spiegel in Germany and La Repubblica in Italy. Edward Snowden, who is in exile in Russia, said in a series of tweets the documents seemed genuine and that only an insider could know this kind of detail. He tweeted:\nThe document dealing with Samsung televisions carries the CIA logo and is described as secret. It adds \u201cUSA/UK\u201d. It says: \u201cAccomplishments during joint workshop with MI5/BTSS (British Security Service) (week of June 16, 2014).\u201d It details how to fake it so that the television appears to be off but in reality can be used to monitor targets. It describes the television as being in \u201cFake Off\u201d mode. Referring to UK involvement, it says: \u201cReceived sanitized source code from UK with comms and encryption removed.\u201d WikiLeaks, in a press release heralding the leak, said: \u201cThe attack against Samsung smart TVs was developed in cooperation with the United Kingdom\u2019s MI5/BTSS. After infestation, Weeping Angel places the target TV in a \u2018Fake Off\u2019 mode, so that the owner falsely believes the TV is off when it is on. In \u2018Fake Off\u2019 mode the TV operates as a bug, recording conversations in the room and sending them over the internet to a covert CIA server.\u201d The role of MI5, the domestic intelligence service, is mainly to track terrorists and foreign intelligence agencies and monitoring along the lines revealed in the CIA documents would require a warrant. The Snowden revelations created tension between the intelligence agencies and the major IT companies upset that the extent of their cooperation with the NSA had been exposed. But the companies were primarily angered over the revelation the agencies were privately working on ways to hack into their products. The CIA revelations risk renewing the friction with the private sector. The initial reaction of members of the intelligence community was to question whether the latest revelations were in the public interest. A source familiar with the CIA\u2019s information security capabilities took issue with WikiLeaks\u2019s comment that the leaker wanted \u201cto initiate a public debate about cyberweapons\u201d. But the source said this was akin to claiming to be worried about nuclear proliferation and then offering up the launch codes for just one country\u2019s nuclear weapons at the moment when a war seemed most likely to begin. Monday\u2019s leaks also reveal that CIA hackers operating out of the Frankfurt consulate are given diplomatic (\u201cblack\u201d) passports and US State Department cover. The documents include instructions for incoming CIA hackers that make Germany\u2019s counter-intelligence efforts appear inconsequential. The document reads: \u201cBreeze through German customs because you have your cover-for-action story down pat, and all they did was stamp your passport. Your cover story (for this trip): Q: Why are you here? A: Supporting technical consultations at the consulate.\u201d The WikiLeaks press release said the leaks also reveal that: \u2022 A number of the CIA\u2019s electronic attack methods are designed for physical proximity. These attack methods are able to penetrate high-security networks that are disconnected from the internet, such as police record databases. In these cases, a CIA officer, agent or allied intelligence officer acting under instructions, physically infiltrates the targeted workplace. The attacker is provided with a USB stick containing malware developed for the CIA for this purpose, which is inserted into the targeted computer. The attacker then infects and extracts data. \u2022 A CIA attack system called Fine Dining provides 24 decoy applications for CIA spies to use. To witnesses, the spy appears to be running a programme showing videos, presenting slides, playing a computer game, or even running a fake virus scanner. But while the decoy application is on the screen, the system is automatically infected and ransacked. The documents also provide travel advice for hackers heading to Frankfurt: \u201cFlying Lufthansa: Booze is free so enjoy (within reason).\u201d The rights group Privacy International, in a statement, said it had long warned about government hacking powers. \u201cInsufficient security protections in the growing amount of devices connected to the internet or so-called \u2018smart\u2019 devices, such as Samsung smart TVs, only compound the problem, giving governments easier access to our private lives,\u201d the group said. \u2022 This article was amended on 22 March 2017 to clarify the attribution of parts of the description of the contents of the leaked material to the WikiLeaks press release.\n", "title": "WikiLeaks publishes 'biggest ever leak of secret CIA documents'"}, {"date": "2016-02-11T23:02:17Z", "body": "The head of the Australian journalists\u2019 union has criticised the government for its heavy-handed threats to media reporting after it emerged that the Australian federal police has accrued a file of at least 200 pages on a Guardian Australia reporter in an attempt to uncover and prosecute his confidential sources.\nPaul Farrell applied under Australia\u2019s privacy law for a copy of his AFP file and received a heavily redacted dossier containing operational centre meeting minutes, file notes, interview records and a plan for an investigation the AFP undertook into one of Farrell\u2019s reports. The investigation of Australian journalists is not rare. Just this week immigration department secretary, Mike Pezzullo, revealed at a Senate estimates committee hearing that he had called in the Australian federal police over a sensitive draft cabinet document about Australia\u2019s humanitarian program that was leaked to the ABC. Pezzullo is also behind the referral of Farrell to the AFP for his 2014 report about an Australian customs ship that had entered far deeper into Indonesian waters than had previously been disclosed. The chief executive of the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, Paul Murphy, said the growing culture of secrecy pervading the government\u2019s approach was disturbing. \u201cThe default position for government agencies now when a story appears seems to be to request the federal police to conduct an investigation into how the story appeared \u2013 and not a concern about the content of the story and a legitimate public interest in these issues,\u201d Murphy told Guardian Australia. \u201cThey are targeting the whistleblower, actually, they would say the whistleblower has breached the Crimes Act. But the method they use to pursue it is trawling the metadata of journalists and we know that because when we met the federal government representatives and the federal police to discuss our concerns about the metadata legislation the AFP admitted that they had accessed the metadata of journalists 13 times in an 18-month period in an effort to identify the source of a published story.\u201d\nImmigration reporting is behind almost every referral made to the AFP by federal government agencies under this Coalition government. \u201cThe culture of secrecy around what happens on Nauru and Manus Island is nothing short of disgraceful, there\u2019s legitimate public concern about what\u2019s being done in our name and efforts to report in the public interest are treated as criminal acts,\u201d Murphy said. The AFP has since released a statement saying the MEAA\u2019s claim is incorrect. \u201cThe AFP has not accessed or applied to access the metadata information belonging to any journalist since 13 October 2015, when new legislation came into effect.\u201d \u201cLegislation surrounding the Telecommunications Act prevents the AFP from publicly releasing specific information to provide further clarity surrounding this inaccurate claim\u201d\nIn an article for Guardian Australia, Farrell writes: \u201cIt\u2019s a mosaic in document form of state surveillance of journalists by police. The files give an insight into the fragile state of journalism in Australia and the ease with which the police choose to take up these investigations because of poorly defined laws.\u201d In 2011 the then Sydney Morning Herald investigative reporters Linton Besser and Dylan Welch were issued with a subpoena by the New South Wales Crime Commission to surrender their mobile phones and sim cards in what was called a witch hunt by their then editor-in-chief, Peter Fray. Fray deplored the threat to public interest journalism and resisted the demand \u2013 which came after the paper published stories about the activities of the NSW Crime Commission. The crown solicitor eventually withdrew the subpoenas. The AFP said investigations relating to breaches of Section 70 of the Crimes Act 1914 were not about targeting journalists. \u201cThe statutory offence relates to a commonwealth officer disclosing commonwealth information without authorisation,\u201d a spokesman told Guardian Australia. \u201cAs journalists are not commonwealth officers pursuant to the act, they cannot be charged with an offence relating to this section. Accordingly, they are not the subject of the investigation. \u201cThe aim of AFP investigations into Section 70 offences is to identify the source of the disclosure, and then determine whether they had the appropriate authority to release that information. \u201cAs journalists may publish and/or broadcast commonwealth material that has been released without authorisation, attempting to identify the source of this release from their contact with the journalist is a clear and legitimate avenue of enquiry for investigators. \u201cSince 13 October 2015, in order to obtain metadata to help identify a journalist\u2019s source, AFP investigators are required to obtain a warrant authorised by a judicial officer. \u201cPrior to an application for a warrant, a Public Interest Advocate must be notified of the pending application and given the opportunity to make submissions regarding the application, including any conditions or restrictions that might be imposed on authorisations made under the warrant.\u201d The AFP said that of the 20 matters accepted for investigation since 1 July 2013, 12 have been finalised, while eight remain active. None are before the courts.\n", "title": "Media union criticises investigations of leaks as police file on Guardian reporter revealed"}, {"date": "2017-03-06T20:23:35Z", "body": "The White House has admitted that Donald Trump does not know what type of surveillance he is alleging he was put under by Barack Obama, despite a tweet on Saturday explicitly saying his phone was tapped. Sean Spicer, the president\u2019s press secretary, argued that there was \u201csubstantial reporting\u201d to show the issue merited congressional investigation, but did not identify Trump\u2019s sources. Trump alleged, without citing evidence, that Obama ordered a wiretap of the phones at Trump\u2019s election campaign headquarters in Trump Tower in New York. \u201cHow low has President Obama gone to tapp [sic] my phones during the very sacred election process,\u201d he tweeted early on Saturday morning. \u201cThis is Nixon/Watergate.

The Guardian reported that the FBI applied for a Fisa warrant over the summer in order to monitor four members of the Trump team suspected of irregular contacts with Russian officials. The Fisa court turned down the application asking FBI counter-intelligence investigators to narrow its focus. According to one report, the FBI was finally granted a warrant in October, but that has not been confirmed, and it is not clear whether any warrant led to a full investigation. On Sunday, Obama\u2019s director of national intelligence, James Clapper, denied any such court order was obtained. But Spicer told reporters on Monday: \u201cIt could be Fisa, it could be surveillance. I think he\u2019s [Trump] made clear that there are continued reports that have been out there. I think the president made it clear yesterday that he wants Congress to go in and look at this. I think there is substantial reporting out there from individuals and from sources.\u201d The White House asked the Republican-led Congress to examine, as part of an ongoing investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in last November\u2019s election, whether the Obama administration abused its authority. But Spicer admitted he could not be more specific about what the abuse might have been. \u201cI think that there\u2019s no question that something happened. The question is, is it surveillance, is it a wiretap, or whatever? \u201cBut there has been enough reporting that strongly suggests that something occurred and I think that\u2019s why what he has said yesterday is that he wants Congress to look into this. And I think that there is enough out there now that makes one wonder how some of this happened without the existence of surveillance.\u201d A journalist attempted to press the issue further but Spicer interrupted him and said: \u201cI\u2019m going to put a pin in this.\u201d He added later: \u201cThe president speaks very candidly. His tweets speak for themselves.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s early Saturday morning tweets \u2013 an extraordinary charge by an incumbent president against a predecessor \u2013 came shortly after similar claims were made by a conservative radio host, later summarised by the rightwing Breitbart News. Pressed specifically on whether Trump based his accusations on a radio host, Spicer said: \u201cHe is not going to comment any further on this,\u201d but added there were \u201cnumerous\u201d reports, including one in the New York Times and \u201cseveral sources brought this to light\u201d. Minutes earlier Spicer had railed against the media for basing reports about possible contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia on anonymous sources. \u201cAt some point I would ask people to take on-the-record sources.\u201d Trump would also ask Congress to look into the issue of \u201cpervasive leaks\u201d of classified information relating to national security, he added. Asked if Trump had spoken to Obama before making the accusation, or indeed whether he had spoken to Obama since moving into the Oval Office, Spicer replied: \u201cI\u2019m not aware of whether or not they\u2019ve talked. I can ask and get back to you.\u201d James Comey, the director of the FBI, asked the justice department to reject the president\u2019s assertion because it was false and must be corrected, according to the New York Times and other media reports. The department has remained silent. Spicer was questioned over whether Trump had spoken to Comey. \u201cTo the best of my knowledge, I\u2019m almost 100% certain he has not,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not aware that actually happened.\u201d Leading Republicans have said they will honour the president\u2019s request to investigate but conceded that they were not aware of any evidence for the president\u2019s assertion. On Monday, Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House oversight and government reform committee, told CBS: \u201cThus far, I have not seen anything directly that would support what the president has said.\u201d\nChaffetz added that it would take time for a House intelligence panel investigating the alleged Russia links to get to the bottom of the wiretapping allegation and that his committee would play a supporting role in this. Meanwhile, Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader in the Senate, called on the Department of Justice\u2019s inspector general to investigate any possible political interference in its inquiries into contacts between Trump\u2019s associates and Russia. \u201cThe American people deserve to know if the investigation into Russia\u2019s interference with our election and the administration\u2019s contact with Russian officials has been compromised by political interference,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cAs we saw last week \u2013 when attorney general Sessions only decided to recuse himself after his misleading Congress regarding Russia contacts became public \u2013 this administration has not been forthcoming about its contacts with Russia, and are too slow to follow DoJ guidelines designed to ensure investigations are fair and independent.\u201d Schumer added: \u201cWe need to ensure that the investigation is impartial, and hasn\u2019t already been compromised in any way by the Trump administration. That\u2019s why I\u2019m calling on the inspector general to get involved immediately.\u201d Fellow Democrat Nancy Pelosi, minority leader in the House, has accused Trump of behaving like an autocrat. \u201cIt\u2019s called a wrap-up smear,\u201d she said. \u201cYou make up something.

At the end of the year, a broad legal authority permitting sweeping surveillance is set to expire. The National Security Agency considers the authority, known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (Fisa), pivotal to fighting terrorism and stopping espionage. Civil libertarians consider the measure \u2013 the wellspring of the NSA\u2019s Prism and \u201cupstream\u201d mass communications-data collection \u2013 unconstitutional. The typical balance of power on Capitol Hill over surveillance is such that opponents of renewing Section 702 face strong political headwinds. The measure was reauthorized with minimal challenge in 2012.\nNow the Republican chairman of the House intelligence committee has thrown reauthorization into question after extensive leaking about Trump and Russia that the president and his Capitol Hill allies have blamed on the US intelligence community. Asked at a Tuesday press conference about the renewal of section 702 in light of ongoing leaks concerning Trump and Russia, Devin Nunes said, \u201cI think it\u2019s very problematic.\u201d He continued: \u201cI\u2019ve expressed this concern to the IC [intelligence community]. We have sent them many followup questions as it relates to intelligence that\u2019s been collected. And we expect prompt answers. I think we also expect unprecedented answers from them of the information that we\u2019re going to be asking for.\u201d First passed in 2008 to give legal cover to George W Bush-era warrantless surveillance, Section 702 permits the NSA to collect communications and associated data from targets it reasonably believes to be non-Americans overseas suspected of contact with a foreign power, even if they are in communication with Americans. The surveillance does not require a court order specifying its targets, purposes, or time frame; only the reapproval of the attorney general and the director of national intelligence. NSA interception of communications between Russian officials or suspected operatives and Trump\u2019s associates would not necessarily involve using Section 702. The NSA or FBI can acquire such communications under the terms of the original 1978 Fisa law. Because of a provision in the law about understanding the foreign-intelligence value of the intercepted communications, neither agency would necessarily have to purge references to Americans. It is not only the NSA that values Section 702 ardently. The FBI director, James Comey, last year called the surveillance activities permitted by Section 702 \u201cfar more important\u201d than the bulk domestic phone-records data program that Congress curtailed in 2015. The FBI is permitted to warrantlessly search through the NSA\u2019s hoards of foreign-focused data with few restrictions. Last week, as the House judiciary committee began hearings over the expiring provision, the Trump administration told Reuters it favors Section 702 reauthorization. \u201cWe support the clean reauthorization and the administration believes it\u2019s necessary to protect the security of the nation,\u201d an anonymous official said. Trump\u2019s nominee for director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, testified that he agreed Section 702 is the \u201ccrown jewels\u201d of US intelligence and the intelligence community \u201calso sees it that way, the entire community\u201d.\nThroughout Barack Obama\u2019s presidency and the Edward Snowden leaks, the vast majority of national-security-focused Republicans embraced the measure without reservation, with Republicans on the intelligence committee leading the way. Nunes himself has been a full-throated defender of Section 702. Last year, he and colleague Lynn Westmoreland of Georgia took point in opposing a civil-libertarian effort to block it through an amendment to a defense-spending bill. Citing the then recent case of Orlando nightclub murderer Omar Mateen, Nunes and Westmoreland circulated a letter to colleagues claiming the loss of 702 would deprive the intelligence community of \u201cthe authorities it needs to detect and stop terrorist attacks\u201d. But since then, Nunes has become a crucial ally to Trump. Nunes served on Trump\u2019s transition team, a closeness that has raised questions about Nunes\u2019 independence as his committee investigates Trump associates\u2019 ties to Russia. Nunes has ardently defended Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and implied without evidence that the intelligence agencies abused their surveillance powers in leaking accounts of Flynn\u2019s December conversations with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, that proved to be his downfall. Trump has blamed the intelligence agencies for the leaks, in particular the FBI and NSA, and his administration has suggested that career intelligence officials are in league with former Obama officials. He has recently taken to claiming, baselessly, that Obama ordered Trump to be surveilled, an act that would be illegal if true. \u201cThere is no evidence to support that claim\u201d of Obama ordering Trump to be wiretapped, a US official told the Guardian over the weekend. But Nunes has given the accusation credence. His committee on 1 March added the \u201cpossible leaks of classified information\u201d that Trump wants investigated to its inquiry on Russian measures to interfere with the 2016 election, which the intelligence agencies publicly assessed in January were for Trump\u2019s benefit. \u201cTypically we\u2019ve had great trust with our intelligence agencies,\u201d Nunes said on Tuesday. \u201cAnd I continue to have that trust, but we have to verify, in fact, that all of the tools that are in place, that we oversee, are being used ethically, responsibly and by the law. And if anybody has abused those, we want to know about that. And that\u2019s part of the reason why it\u2019s important for us to know whether or not, as some press reports have indicated, the Department of Justice or any other agency tried to get the warrant on anybody related to the Trump campaign or any other campaign for that matter.\u201d Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said the authority under Section 702 would be preserved when asked by the Guardian on Tuesday about Nunes\u2019 comments. But he did not rule out potential reforms to the law if necessary. \u201cSection 702 has been a far more impactful and important counter-terrorism program and tool,\u201d Schiff said during a press conference on Capitol Hill. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean though that we shouldn\u2019t explore whether there are ways to improve any of the protections in existing law or whether there are any changes that we need to make to the structure of the program.\u201d Schiff said the intelligence committee had been engaged in periodic briefings with members, given the law is poised to sunset this year. Should any questions come up in the same context that are pertinent to the Russia investigation, he added, they \u201cought to be answered so members understand how the program works [and] that it\u2019s conducted in a lawful way.\u201d\n", "title": "Trump v US intelligence: growing feud puts NSA's legislative priority at risk"}, {"date": "2016-03-18T12:09:38Z", "body": "Thousands of US government employees under permanent surveillance are being investigated for signs of \u201cgreed\u201d, \u201cego\u201d, money worries, disgruntlement or other flaws in the hope of intercepting the next big official leak, according to a document obtained by Chelsea Manning. The extent of the government\u2019s internal surveillance system designed to prevent massive leaks of the sort linked to WikiLeaks and the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden is revealed in the document, published here by the Guardian for the first time. The US soldier, who is serving 35 years in military prison as the source of the 2010 WikiLeaks disclosure of secret state documents, requested her own intelligence file under freedom of information laws. The file was compiled under the \u201cInsider Threat\u201d program that was set up by President Obama in the wake of Manning\u2019s disclosures. The file shows that officials have been using Manning\u2019s story as a case study from which they have built a profile of the modern official leaker in the hope of catching future disclosures before they happen.\nAt the start of the 31-page file, government officials list the eight characteristics that agents should look for in employees as telltale signs that they might be tempted to reveal state secrets. The character traits are called \u201cInsider Threat motives\u201d. Those surveillance categories are themselves extracted from an analysis of Chelsea Manning\u2019s story. In the document Manning is referred to in male gender pronouns as the file was composed on 14 April 2014 \u2013 nine days before the prisoner was legally allowed to change her name as part of her transition as a transgender woman.\nThe Insider Threat analysis claims that Manning displayed several of those eight core motives of the prototype leaker. Before she transmitted hundreds of thousands of secret documents to WikiLeaks, she showed signs of disgruntlement, the file states. She also subscribed to the ideology that all information should be made public, which the officials suggested stemmed from her association with \u201cself-proclaimed \u2018hackers\u2019\u201d. In an opinion article in the Guardian, Manning said that the use of subjective labels in her file such as \u201cgreed\u201d, \u201cdisgruntlement\u201d and \u201cideology\u201d meant that virtually every government employee could be targeted under the Insider Threat program. \u201cThe broad sweep of the program means officials have been given a blank check for surveillance.\u201d Manning writes that the program \u201cworks against innovation, creativity and the prevention of institutional corruption. Perhaps this is the real intent \u2026 to instill fear and project dominance throughout the intelligence community, the military and among government employees and contractors at large.\u201d\nThe government has already put about 100,000 military and civilian employees and contractors under what it calls \u201ccontinuous evaluation\u201d, according to documents obtained by Steven Aftergood at the Federation of American Scientists. He told the Guardian that the character traits deployed in the Insider Threat file on Manning were strikingly similar to the formula used to detect traitors and spies during the cold war. Back then they used the acronym Mice, standing for \u201cmoney, ideology, coercion or ego\u201d. Aftergood said that the cold war record showed that the focus on those characteristics were not all that successful in sniffing out vulnerabilities. \u201cThey are not necessarily useful ways of predicting what an individual will do \u2013 that remains difficult though not entirely impossible.\u201d The expansion of the Insider Threat program has raised fears among whistleblower groups that it will spread paranoia among employees and make it increasingly difficult for workers who have concerns about corruption or other misconduct to sound the alarm. Thomas Drake, a former NSA senior executive who blew the whistle on problems and inefficiencies within the agency was prosecuted under the 1917 Espionage Act, said that the program was a form of mass surveillance of the government\u2019s own workers that he likened to a dystopia. \u201cIt puts employees under \u2018continuous evaluation\u2019 \u2013 interesting phrase \u2013 for all their activities including their outside actions and financial accounts. Whistleblowers and those who speak truth to power, especially when it\u2019s about national security, are going to get hammered.\u201d In an Insider Threat presentation from last year, officials placed Drake and Snowden \u2013 two whistleblowers who sounded the alarm about what they saw as government excesses for no financial gain \u2013 within a gallery of \u201cthose who have done us harm\u201d alongside Soviet spies Aldrich Ames and Robert Hannsen and Fort Hood mass shooter Nidal Hasan.\nJesselyn Radack, who heads the Whistleblower and Source Protection program at ExposeFacts and who represents both Drake and Snowden, called Insider Threat a \u201cmodern-day McCarthyism that has friends and colleagues spy on and report each other. It effectively stifles workplace free speech, dissent and is openly trying to deter whistleblowers.\u201d The Insider Threat file on Manning suggests that the soldier\u2019s gender dysphoria \u2013 where her gender identity is out of sync with her gender at birth \u2013 was also a character trait that could have been used to predict her desire to leak state secrets. Chase Strangio, the ACLU lawyer who represents Manning in her legal disputes with the US military relating to her gender transition, said that the file was yet another example of the soldier\u2019s voice and identity being used against her. \u201cThey are using her gender identity to suggest it fits into an offender profile.\u201d Strangio said the implication of the document was that anyone who pushes back on injustice against LGBT people within the military should be considered an insider threat. \u201cWe are seeing that argument used over and over again in Chelsea\u2019s case.\u201d\n", "title": "Chelsea Manning: government anti-leak program a 'blank check for surveillance'"}, {"date": "2016-03-25T12:43:40Z", "body": "SAS forces have been deployed in Libya since the beginning of the year, according to a confidential briefing given to US congressional leaders by the king of Jordan. A leaked memo indicates the US lawmakers were personally briefed by King Abdullah in January about plans for Jordan\u2019s special forces to operate in the country alongside the British. According to the notes of the meeting in the week of 11 January, seen by the Guardian, King Abdullah confirmed his country\u2019s own special forces \u201cwill be imbedded [sic] with British SAS\u201d in Libya. According to the memo, the monarch met with US congressional leaders \u2013 including John McCain, the chairman of the Senate armed services committee, and Bob Corker, the chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee. Also present was the House of Representatives speaker, Paul Ryan. King Abdullah said UK special forces needed his soldiers\u2019 assistance when operating on the ground in north Africa, explaining \u201cJordanian slang is similar to Libyan slang\u201d. The king also highlighted that British forces had helped in building up a mechanised battalion in southern Syria, headed by a local commander and made up of tribal fighters, to combat Bashar al-Assad\u2019s army, and that his troops were ready with Britain and Kenya to go \u201cover the border\u201d to attack al-Shabaab in Somalia. When contacted, the Ministry of Defence said it did not comment on special forces\u2019 operations. None of the high-ranking US senators contacted by the Guardian responded to a request for interview. However, one senate source confirmed US lawmakers met with the king in a private meeting in early January but refused to confirm \u201cwhat may or may not have been discussed\u201d.\nThe full passage of the briefing notes says: \u201cOn Libya His Majesty said he expects a spike in a couple of weeks and Jordanians will be imbedded [sic] with British SAS, as Jordanian slang is similar to Libyan slang.\u201d The monarch\u2019s apparent openness with the US lawmakers is an indication of just how important an ally Jordan is to the US in the region. Since the 1950s Washington has provided it with more than $15bn (\u00a310.5bn) in economic and military aid. However, the Jordanians had become frustrated over perceived US inaction over the Middle East in recent months. Five years of fighting in Syria have dramatically impacted on Jordan, which has absorbed more than 630,000 Syrian refugees, and the king has repeatedly called for decisive action to end the conflict.\nHe told those present: \u201cThe problem is bigger than Isil [Islamic State], this is a third world war, this is Christians, Jews working with Muslims against outlaws.\u201d The memo indicates that Abdullah also told US lawmakers: \u2022 The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, \u201cbelieves in a radical Islamic solution to the problems in the region\u201d and the \u201cfact that terrorists are going to Europe is part of Turkish policy, and Turkey keeps getting a slap on the hand, but they get off the hook\u201d. \u2022 Intelligence agencies want to keep terrorist websites \u201copen so they can use them to track extremists\u201d and Google had told the Jordanian monarch \u201cthey have 500 people working on this\u201d. \u2022 Israel \u201clooks the other way\u201d at the al-Qaida affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra on its border with Syria because \u201cthey regard them as an opposition to Hezbollah\u201d. The king raised particular concerns over al-Shabaab, the Islamist militant group in Somalia that has links with both Isis and al-Qaida. \u201cJordan is looking at al-Shabaab because no one was really looking at the issue, and we cannot separate this issue, and the need to look at all the hotspots in the map,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe have a rapid deployment force that will stand with the British and Kenya and is ready to go over the border [into Somalia].\u201d Abdullah said \u201cwe started with al-Shabaab, as they feed into Libya\u201d, which has descended into chaos since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi by Nato forces.\nIn Britain, it is the Jordanian monarch\u2019s confirmation of the SAS operating with his forces in north Africa that will raise eyebrows. The issue of the oversight of the operations of British special forces has become a vexed matter in parliament. Earlier this week, David Cameron rejected a call from Angus Robertson, the Scottish National party\u2019s Westminster leader, for the SAS to be subject to parliamentary oversight, saying they were already \u201csubject to international law as everyone else is in our country but I do not propose to change the arrangements under which these incredibly brave men work\u201d. Crispin Blunt, the foreign affairs select committee chair, who has been concerned that parliament has been left in the dark about British involvement in Libya, told the Guardian he had known King Abdullah since they both served in the 13th/18th Royal Hussars. \u201cKing Abdullah gives a level of insight that we don\u2019t get from our own governments,\u201d said Blunt. \u201cHe has given presentations to parliamentarians behind closed doors in the past. We don\u2019t get that from our own ministers. When [the foreign office minister] Tobias Ellwood told us about RAF flights over Libya these were plainly in support of special forces missions. But when we asked for details we were told the government doesn\u2019t comment on special forces. \u201cThere is a tendency for the British establishment to work out everything very carefully and then present it to parliament as \u2018a take it or leave it\u2019 choice. And then ministers wonder why they have difficulties in parliament.\u201d In March, intelligence analysts at Stratfor said UK special forces were already in Libya and \u201cescorting MI6 teams to meet with Libyan officials about supplying weapons and training to the Syrian army and to militias against the Islamic State. The British air force bases Sentinel aircraft in Cyprus for surveillance missions around [the Isis Libyan stronghold] Sirte as well.\u201d\nAccusations that Cameron\u2019s lax attitude to Libya contributed to the country\u2019s disastrous collapse resurfaced after Barack Obama suggested in an interview with Atlantic magazine this month that the chaos in north Africa was caused in part because the British prime minister was too distracted to oversee a smooth transformation to a new stable regime.\nHowever, in recent weeks there has been a flurry of international activity to stabilise Libya, with British officials prominently pushing a peace process. Under a plan disclosed late last year, the UK will offer the new Libyan government 1,000 troops as part of an internationally coordinated effort. Blunt says he has called on Cameron to give evidence to his committee, writing to Downing St to say that \u201cgiven the prime minister\u2019s key role in the development of international policy before, during and after the 2011 intervention \u2013 a role which is continuing now with the formation of the government of national accord \u2013 the committee believes it is only appropriate to extend this invitation to you in a spirit of courtesy, fairness and genuine inquiry\u201d. When contacted, Downing Street did not respond to questions about whether the prime minister would give evidence to MPs. Jordanian embassies in London and Washington did not comment on the leaks.\n", "title": "SAS deployed in Libya since start of year, says leaked memo"}, {"date": "2017-03-08T13:49:03Z", "body": "Apple has promised to \u201crapidly address\u201d any security holes used by the CIA to hack iPhones, following the release of a huge tranche of documents covering the intelligence agency\u2019s stockpile of software vulnerabilities. The leak, dubbed \u201cVault 7\u201d by its publisher WikiLeaks, is made up of a collection of around 10,000 individual documents created between 2014 and 2016. A spokesman for the CIA said it would not comment \u201con the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents\u201d and the Trump administration spokesman Sean Spicer also declined comment. Apple, one of numerous tech companies whose devices appear to have been targeted, released a statement late on Tuesday saying many of the vulnerabilities described by the documents were already fixed as of the latest version of its iOS mobile operating system, and aimed to reassure customers that it was working on patching the rest of the holes. It said: \u201cWhile our initial analysis indicates that many of the issues leaked today were already patched in the latest iOS, we will continue work to rapidly address any identified vulnerabilities,\u201d it added. \u201cWe always urge customers to download the latest iOS to make sure they have the most recent security updates.\u201d Other companies mentioned in the leaks, including Microsoft and Samsung, gave briefer statements. \u201cWe are aware of the report and are looking into it,\u201d Microsoft said. Samsung said: \u201cProtecting consumers\u2019 privacy and the security of our devices is a top priority at Samsung. We are aware of the report in question and are urgently looking into the matter.\u201d Google has yet to comment on the leaks, which contain a sizeable amount of information on how to target its Android operating system. While Apple has tried to reassure customers that \u201cmany\u201d of the vulnerabilities mentioned in the document have now been fixed, the leak itself represents just a snapshot in time of the CIA\u2019s capabilities, which may have developed further since the documents were created. One page of the leak, which focuses on iOS exploits, shows the most recent version of iOS as 9.2. That version was released in December 2015, implying that the iOS-specific document was created between 8 December that year and 15 January 2016, when iOS 9.2.1 was made available. That page shows some exploits, such as one named \u201cNandao\u201d and apparently discovered by Britain\u2019s GCHQ, which were unknown outside the intelligence community at the time the document was created. Such an exploit is known as a \u201czero-day\u201d vulnerability, for the number of days the manufacturer has had to fix the problem.\nIt takes many separate vulnerabilities to craft a full malware kit that can be used to remotely take control of a smartphone. The WikiLeaks document lists six separate vulnerabilities required to remotely exploit an iPhone running iOS 9.2, with codenames like Saline, MiniMe and Juggernaut, and a manufacturer fixing any one of those holes can weaken an attacker\u2019s capabilities. The requirement to keep such zero-day exploits secret from the manufacturer, lest they be fixed, also explains why they are unlikely to be used for anything other than targeted surveillance, security experts say. In August 2016, for instance, Apple issued a global iOS update after three zero-day attacks were found being used to try and break into the iPhone of an Arab human rights activist. The quantity of exploits referred to in the Vault 7 leak has also drawn fresh criticism of the CIA and other intelligence agencies\u2019 practice of purchasing or otherwise discovering security flaws in popular hardware and software, and failing to disclose the flaws to the manufacturers. \u201cHere\u2019s the big deal,\u201d tweeted Edward Snowden, the source of a previous huge leak of NSA hacking capabilities: \u201cFirst public evidence USG [US government] secretly paying to keep US software unsafe. The CIA reports show the USG developing vulnerabilities in US products, then intentionally keeping the holes open. Reckless beyond words.\u201d Publicly, the US government has insisted that it doesn\u2019t stockpile such exploits, instead reporting \u201cthe greatest numbers of vulnerabilities\u201d it finds, rather than keeping them secret. But it has always maintained the right to keep particularly critical vulnerabilities secret if they have \u201ca clear national security or law enforcement\u201d use.

The latest surveillance battle gripping the technology industry is focused on a rewrite of US surveillance law that would mean the justice department would be able to access a citizen\u2019s web browsing history, location data and some email records without approval from a judge using a so-called \u201cnational security letters\u201d (NSLs). The FBI contends that such data is covered implicitly under current statute, which was written years ago and only explicitly covers data normally associated with telephone records. Director James Comey now is lobbying Congress to make clear it also applies to the digital equivalent. Late on Monday, major technology companies including Google, Facebook and Yahoo sent a letter warning Congress that they would oppose any efforts to rewrite law in the FBI\u2019s favor. \u201cThis expansion of the NSL statute has been characterized by some government officials as merely fixing a \u2018typo\u2019 in the law,\u201d the companies wrote. \u201cIn reality, however, it would dramatically expand the ability of the FBI to get sensitive information about users\u2019 online activities without court oversight.\u201d It marks another battle over a small clause in federal law that could dramatically affect how the US conducts terrorism investigations. For years, the bureau has relied on the controversial national security letters to obtain certain types of data quickly from technology companies. These letters don\u2019t require a warrant and often come with a gag order prohibiting the recipients from discussing them. Technology companies complain the FBI has become too reliant on them, but the FBI complains that cases are getting slowed down because some companies have stopped cooperating. It\u2019s not so much that technology companies don\u2019t want to give any user data to the government. Rather, their legal teams have problems with the growth of national security letters because the accompanying gag orders prevent companies from telling users much about how they help the government. This can create mistrust and, as happened after the Edward Snowden leaks, eventual embarrassment if the details are disclosed. Companies also argue NSLs are problematic because of the lack of judicial oversight. They give too much power to one branch of government, they argue, and make it hard to predict what the government may ask for next. Comey has said expanding NSL rules is one of his agencies top legislative priorities. US senators are exploring multiple ways to pass the law tweak this year. Technology and legal experts also dispute Comey\u2019s argument that he effectively is asking Congress to correct a typo. In 2008, the justice department\u2019s office of legal counsel said explicitly that the agency can only issue national security letters for \u201cname, address, length of service, and local and long distance toll billing records\u201d. At the time, the government had asked DoJ\u2019s lawyer if those four types of data are \u201cexhaustive or merely illustrative of the information that the FBI may request and a provider may turn over\u201d.

The agency said this mass data collection had been kept secret in order to protect Americans. Holder, who led the justice department during the document leak, said Snowden \u201charmed American interests\u201d by releasing the files. \u201cI know there are ways in which certain of our agents were put at risk, relationships with other countries were harmed, our ability to keep the American people safe was compromised,\u201d Holder told Axelrod. \u201cThere were all kinds of re-dos that had to be put in place as a result of what he did, and while those things were being done, we were blind in certain really critical areas. So what he did was not without consequence.\u201d Though Holder said Snowden should return to the US to face trial, he added that any judge who tried him should account for his contribution to the debate about mass surveillance. \u201cI think in deciding what an appropriate sentence should be, I think a judge could take into account the usefulness of having had that national debate,\u201d Holder said.\nSnowden has said repeatedly that he would return to the US if he could get a fair trial. \u201cBut, as I think you\u2019re quite familiar, the Espionage Act does not permit a public interest defense,\u201d Snowden told a University of Chicago event earlier this month. \u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to speak the word \u2018whistleblower\u2019 at trial.\u201d Snowden, who was a contractor for the NSA, has lived in Russia in the years following the leaks.

Snowden responded to Holder\u2019s comments on Twitter on Monday night.\nThe frontrunners in the 2016 presidential race, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, have said Snowden should be punished, though they disagree in how serious that punishment should be. In a Democratic debate in October, Clinton said Snowden should return and be put on trial. Bernie Sanders, now the only other Democratic contender, agreed, though he said he thought Snowden \u201cplayed a very important role in educating the American public\u201d. In 2013, Trump implied that Snowden should be executed. In March, he said the US should get Snowden back from Russia because he is a spy. The Kremlin said it would not entertain such a plan.\nHolder has shown some leniency toward Snowden before, but his use of the phrase \u201cpublic service\u201d turned heads. In January 2014, Holder told an audience at the University of Virginia that the government could accept a plea deal with Snowden if he were to return to the US and plead guilty to criminal charges. He reiterated the possibility of a plea deal last year, after stepping down from his post as the country\u2019s top law enforcement officer in April 2015 and returning to private practice with the Washington law firm Covington & Burling. \u201cI certainly think there could be a basis for a resolution that everybody could ultimately be satisfied with,\u201d Holder told Yahoo News in July 2015.

Germany is already facing \u201ca daily task\u201d of responding to Russian cyber-attacks, Merkel says. Security experts suggest Russia may think it would be better able to deal with a more leftwing government than the current grand coalition led by Merkel, a center-right conservative. The trail of evidence in many recent hacks points to Russia, says Martin Schallbruch, deputy director of the Digital Society Institute in Berlin. \u201cIt\u2019s significant that attacks like this increasingly try to capture large volumes of data, as was the case with the DNC, in order to do something with them in the future,\u201d Schallbruch said. \u201cWe\u2019re a year away from German national elections. And an attacker who stocks up on information today is better capable of action in nine months, be it leaking that information or blackmailing someone. It\u2019s conceivable. We\u2019ve seen it in the US, so why not in Germany?\u201d Cyber-warfare also hit France\u2019s TV5 Monde television channel in April 2015, forcing it off the air and placing jihadist propaganda messages on the station\u2019s website and social media accounts.\nIn the Philippines, just a month before the presidential election in May 2016, the government suffered probably its worst ever data breach, while a few months earlier the Philippine Commission on Elections saw its website defaced and its entire database posted online. Ryan Flores, a senior manager at IT security firm Trend Micro, said the government\u2019s cybersecurity vulnerabilities could lead to the election being \u201csabotaged\u201d. In the UK, the leaked Panama Papers revealed that the then UK prime minister David Cameron had personally profited from a tax-dodging stash of \u00a330,000 in an offshore investment fund set up by his father. As de facto leader of the Remain campaign in the \u201cBrexit\u201d vote to leave the European Union, Cameron lost public credibility over the incident and damaged the campaign to stay in the EU. By the time the US election rolled around, Americans were confused and reeling after a vicious campaign, and both Donald Trump and Clinton had unprecedented negative ratings from voters.\nEven the possibility of being embarrassed by a leak will discourage some people from running for office. How many good potential candidates are so squeaky clean that she or he can survive having snatches of conversations or emails ripped out of context and splashed across the headlines? Or having the email archives of a candidate\u2019s closest advisers (such as Clinton\u2019s election campaign chairman, John Podesta) raked through for scandal material? Technology has certainly affected elections before, most famously with the sensation caused by the John Kennedy-Richard Nixon television debates. Those who watched the debates on TV thought Kennedy won, and those who heard it on the radio thought Nixon won. But the recent US presidential election is the first time technology has played such a central role in digging into private lives, hacking into private communications, unearthing what was previously unearthable \u2013 and then providing the means to broadcast that all over the world. Adding to the mystery and tragedy is the apparent likelihood that foreign governments increasingly have the capabilities to do this to each other, trying to sway the outcome of elections and help the voters of another nation pick a leader they find more palatable. Allowing Julian Assange or Vladimir Putin to become the kingmakers for important elections all over the world seems like a shortcut toward a democratic death spiral. We need to consider the vastly disproportionate influence of technology, because the critical processes and institutions of democracy may be more fragile than we thought.

Assange said he would contact technology companies to privately supply technical details of the hacking techniques and security vulnerabilities that were redacted from the cache of classified documents released to the public. \u201cWe have decided to work with them, to give them some exclusive access to some of the technical details we have, so that fixes can be pushed out,\u201d Assange said in a news conference streamed from the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he has claimed diplomatic asylum since 2012.\nBut members of the security community have dismissed Assange\u2019s hyperbole around the CIA files \u2013 collectively nicknamed \u201cVault 7\u201d \u2013 which he described as \u201cexceptional from a political, legal and forensic perspective\u201d. Ryan Kalember, SVP of Cybersecurity Strategy at Proofpoint, disagreed. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing earth-shattering,\u201d he said, pointing out that many of the operating systems mentioned in the documents are quite old and have already been updated. \u201cIt seems like the CIA was doing the same stuff cybersecurity researchers do, which is compile lists of vulnerabilities and try to figure out which ones are being exploited in the wild and which ones could be.\u201d It\u2019s not clear at this point how many, if any, of the vulnerabilities are genuine \u201czero-days\u201d \u2013 those not yet known to vendors, named after the number of days they have to fix them. Kalember said that the so-called Weeping Angel hack, which uses malware to spy on Samsung smart TVs, has been shown at security conferences for a couple of years and requires physical access to the device. \u201cThe CIA should be embarrassed that they lost control of this cache, but they should also be embarrassed if this is their level of technical sophistication,\u201d said another another security researcher, who did not want to be named. \u201cWhat they have is pretty unimpressive.\u201d Both said that the vulnerabilities detailed in the documents are likely to have already been patched by the companies. Apple and Google have both publicly stated this is the case. There could be more to come, however: Assange has emphasized that the data cache released on Tuesday is only a portion of the total leaked information WikiLeaks holds. \u201cThe fact that Julian Assange is offering to selectively disclose vulnerability information to affected companies is better than revealing it to all and sundry, but it depends on the veracity, accuracy and currency of that information,\u201d said BullGuard CEO Paul Lipman. \u201cI don\u2019t think WikiLeaks is the first stop for tech companies looking to solve vulnerabilities,\u201d he added. How do the CIA files compare with the revelations contained in the NSA leaks from whistleblower Edward Snowden? \u201cIt\u2019s apples and oranges,\u201d said Kalember. \u201cThe Snowden leaks were not only technically interesting but contained a lot of novel stuff that was not known at all.\u201d He said that with Vault 7, he and other members of the cybersecurity community have spent a lot of time \u201claughing about funny things on the CIA\u2019s intranet\u201d (like this collection of emoticons) rather than \u201cdebating anything interesting from a tech perspective\u201d.\nSome researchers were skeptical of WikiLeaks\u2019 motives, pointing to apparent ties between the whistleblowing organization and Russia \u2013 despite Assange\u2019s denial. \u201cEverything they have done over the last few months suggests they are operating as a front for a different leaker [Russia],\u201d said Kalember. He said that the possible Russian ties as well as WikiLeaks\u2019 track record of publishing identifying information about people (known as \u201cdoxxing\u201d) \u2013 including millions of women in Turkey \u2013 and threats to make an online database of all verified users on Twitter \u2013 has diminished confidence in the organization. \u201cNo one in the information security community really trusts him and his motives,\u201d he said. At the press conference, Assange attempted to counter accusations that he or WikiLeaks had ties to Russian intelligence agencies, describing his operation as \u201ca neutral, digital Switzerland\u201d. WikiLeaks\u2019 promotion of the CIA files has placed emphasis on a group at the agency called Umbrage, which collects a library of attack techniques produced in other states including, the press release stated, the Russian Federation. \u201cWith Umbrage and related projects the CIA cannot only increase its total number of attack types but also misdirect attribution by leaving behind the \u2018fingerprints\u2019 of the groups that the attack techniques were stolen from,\u201d WikiLeaks said. This could be interpreted as an attempt by WikiLeaks to undermine the attribution of the DNC hack to the Russians \u2013 something that the international security community almost unanimously agrees on. \u201cThey place a lot of emphasis on the fact that the CIA could be using malware to achieve its ends and leave trails that point to people in different directions. Everybody does this, but it\u2019s not going to genuinely undermine proper attribution,\u201d he said.\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped conservative media figures from embracing the conspiracy theory, amplified by a flood of Twitter bots spouting memes and a similar narrative. \u201cI think at this point Assange is effectively acting in the service of the Russian government, whether intentionally or not,\u201d said Kalember.\n", "title": "Silicon Valley shrugs off Julian Assange's help \u2013 and questions his motives"}, {"date": "2016-11-04T14:01:55Z", "body": "Deep antipathy to Hillary Clinton exists within the FBI, multiple bureau sources have told the Guardian, spurring a rapid series of leaks damaging to her campaign just days before the election. Current and former FBI officials, none of whom were willing or cleared to speak on the record, have described a chaotic internal climate that resulted from outrage over director James Comey\u2019s July decision not to recommend an indictment over Clinton\u2019s maintenance of a private email server on which classified information transited. \u201cThe FBI is Trumpland,\u201d said one current agent. This atmosphere raises major questions about how Comey and the bureau he is slated to run for the next seven years can work with Clinton should she win the White House.\nThe currently serving FBI agent said Clinton is \u201cthe antichrist personified to a large swath of FBI personnel,\u201d and that \u201cthe reason why they\u2019re leaking is they\u2019re pro-Trump.\u201d The agent called the bureau \u201cTrumplandia\u201d, with some colleagues openly discussing voting for a GOP nominee who has garnered unprecedented condemnation from the party\u2019s national security wing and who has pledged to jail Clinton if elected.\nAt the same time, other sources dispute the depth of support for Trump within the bureau, though they uniformly stated that Clinton is viewed highly unfavorably. \u201cThere are lots of people who don\u2019t think Trump is qualified, but also believe Clinton is corrupt. What you hear a lot is that it\u2019s a bad choice, between an incompetent and a corrupt politician,\u201d said a former FBI official. Sources who disputed the depth of Trump\u2019s internal support agreed that the FBI is now in parlous political territory. Justice department officials \u2013 another current target of FBI dissatisfaction \u2013 have said the bureau disregarded longstanding rules against perceived or actual electoral interference when Comey wrote to Congress to say it was reviewing newly discovered emails relating to Clinton\u2019s personal server.\nComey\u2019s vague letter to Congress, promptly leaked by Republican congressman Jason Chaffetz, said the bureau would evaluate communications \u2013 subsequently identified as coming from a device used by disgraced ex-congressman Anthony Weiner, whose estranged wife Huma Abedin is a Clinton aide \u2013 for connections to the Clinton server. Comey\u2019s allies say he was placed in an impossible position after previously testifying to Congress it would take an extraordinary development for him to revisit the Clinton issue. Throughout the summer and fall, Trump has attacked the FBI as corrupt for not effectively ending Clinton\u2019s political career. A political firestorm erupted, with Comey and the bureau coming under withering criticism, including a rebuke on Wednesday from Barack Obama. Even some congressional Republicans, no friends to Clinton, have expressed discomfort with Comey\u2019s last-minute insertion of the bureau into the election. The relevance of the communications to the Clinton inquiry has yet to be established, as Comey issued his letter before obtaining a warrant to evaluate them. Clinton surrogates contend that Comey has issued innuendo rather than evidence, preventing them from mounting a public defense.\nSome feel Comey needs to address the criticism and provide reassurance that the bureau, with its wide-ranging investigative and surveillance powers, will comport itself in an apolitical manner. Yet since Friday, Comey has maintained his silence, even as both Clinton and Trump have called for the bureau to disclose more of what it knows. Leaks, however, have continued. Fox News reported on Wednesday that the FBI is intensifying an investigation into the Clinton Foundation over allegations \u2013 which both the foundation and the Clinton camp deny \u2013 it traded donations for access to Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state. The Wall Street Journal reported that justice department officials considered the allegations flimsy. The leaks have not exclusively cast aspersions on Clinton. Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, is the subject of what is said to be a preliminary FBI inquiry into his business dealings in Russia. Manafort has denied any wrongdoing. The Daily Beast reported on Thursday on ties between Trump surrogate Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor, and the FBI\u2019s New York field office, which reportedly pressed the FBI to revisit the Clinton server investigation after beginning an inquiry into Weiner\u2019s alleged sexual texting with a minor. The website reported that a former New York field office chief, highly critical of the non-indictment, runs a military charity that has received significant financial donations from Trump. Comey\u2019s decision to tell the public in July that he was effectively dropping the Clinton server issue angered some within the bureau, particularly given the background of tensions with the justice department over the Clinton issue. A significant complication is the appearance of a conflict of interest regarding Loretta Lynch, the attorney general, who met with Bill Clinton this summer ahead of Comey\u2019s announcement, which she acknowledged had \u201ccast a shadow\u201d over the inquiry.\n\u201cMany FBI agents were upset at the director, not because he didn\u2019t [recommend to] indict, but they believe he threw the FBI under the bus by taking the heat away from DoJ [Department of Justice],\u201d the former bureau official said. All this has compounded pressure on Comey, with little end in sight. Jim Wedick, who retired from the bureau in 2004 after 35 years, said that if Clinton is elected, she and Comey would probably find a way to work together out of a sense of pragmatism. He recalled both his own occasional clashes with federal prosecutors and Bill Clinton\u2019s uneasy relationship with his choice for FBI director, Louis Freeh. \u201cEach one will find a way to pick at the other. It\u2019s not going to be good and it\u2019s not going to be pretty. But they\u2019ll both have to work with each other,\u201d he said. Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat on the intelligence committee, said: \u201cThe continued leadership failures at the FBI are another reminder we can\u2019t let intelligence agencies say \u2018trust us\u2019 and then give them a blank check to probe into Americans\u2019 lives. \u201cWhile I\u2019ve argued for years that Congress must create ironclad protections for Americans\u2019 security and privacy, we also need vigilant oversight of agencies that have the power to deprive citizens of their liberty or change the course of an election.\u201d The FBI would not comment for this story.\n", "title": "'The FBI is Trumpland': anti-Clinton atmosphere spurred leaking, sources say"}, {"date": "2016-08-18T17:43:35Z", "body": "Oliver Stone looks overwhelmed. It is May 2015, and we are in Munich on the penultimate day of shooting his drama about Edward Snowden. At lunch, the director seems anxious and weary, eyes heavy, shoulders stooped, energy sapped. When the idea of Snowden was proposed, he explains, he had strongly resisted. Then, slowly and reluctantly, he was drawn in. Today, he sounds as if he might regret that decision. There have been problems with finance, with finding distributors, in portraying something as dull as the cyberworld that Snowden inhabits. \u201cA director has to say everything is great, things are wonderful,\u201d he says, exasperated. \u201cEvery day on a set is a potential disaster. Every day on a film set is the hope that it is turning out well, but the truth is it is just a slog all the way through. It\u2019s the bulldozer going through a treeline. It is not easy. It has never been easy.\u201d This film, in particular, was not easy. \u201cEvery movie I have made is a challenge. But from day one, every day seems to have its obstacles, whether it is computers or the technology being arcane, difficult to understand, or the character of Snowden, who has a strong, robot, nerd quality. It is a drawback. He is not the active type.\u201d As Stone headed back to the set, his final comment expressed his limited ambition for the movie at that time: \u201cI don\u2019t want to do anything that will hurt Edward Snowden.\u201d Almost a year later, I meet Stone again, in London. The tiredness is gone. This is a man full of enthusiasm for life and his movie. The editing has gone well, he feels; the previous week a positive reaction had met an early preview in Idaho \u2013 despite his sense of dread. \u201cAs a director, I think the film has a power beyond its details,\u201d he says, beaming. \u201cMaybe no one will come. But those people that come will see something they have not seen before. There are no chases. There are no murders. I love tension but there is a different kind of tension \u2026 What Snowden did in history, I believe, will make a difference. I don\u2019t think it is going to go away.\u201d It was a few months after the story first broke in summer 2013 that Stone was approached by Anatoly Kucherena, Snowden\u2019s lawyer in Russia, about making a movie about his client. It caught him, he says, at a low point. A project about Martin Luther King had failed to come to fruition. He didn\u2019t fancy embarking on another complicated proposition unlikely to make it to the multiplex. Nonetheless, he went to Moscow, met the man himself, and was sufficiently intrigued to do further research and buy up film rights to Kurcherena\u2019s fictional account of an American whistleblower, Time of the Octopus, as well as Guardian correspondent Luke Harding\u2019s The Snowden Files. I first met Stone six or so months later, when he visited the Guardian. I was called into the office of the then-editor, Alan Rusbridger, and was pleased at the prospect, never having met a Hollywood director before. This was also one whose films I had enjoyed. There were a handful of us in the room and we chatted for about hour. The reason I was there was that, along with fellow journalists Laura Poitras and Glenn Greenwald, I had met Snowden in Hong Kong, where he handed over tens of thousands of top-secret US and British documents to us \u2013 one of the biggest leaks in intelligence history \u2013 before going into hiding. Stone wanted to hear the account firsthand. At that point, I wasn\u2019t sure what to make of the director, but I was impressed by the detail he had already accumulated about Snowden.\nI met him next in December 2014, alone over lunch in London. I was half-an-hour late but he did not make a fuss: there was nothing of primadonna to him. Instead, he cracked on with his questions. There were a lot of them. They were followed up with emails and phone calls. I liked this obsessiveness, more journalist than film director; a stubborn pursuit of the unanswered in an effort to complete a picture. In the end, Stone and his co-writer Kieran Fitzgerald interviewed almost everyone involved. He spoke to lawyers, journalists and former members of the NSA. He went to the Ecuadorean embassy in London to talk to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. And he met Snowden\u2019s partner, Lindsay Mills. He went to Moscow at least eight times to meet Snowden. Too much research, Stone says. About 80% had to be ditched. Not time wasted though, he says \u2013 it gave him the clarity he hankered after. We are now back in Munich, two days after the UK general election: a time of great industry and excitement in a newspaper. Filming, by contrast, is boring. I had never been on a movie set before and I am glad I had the chance to see behind the scenes. But I had somehow imagined it might be a bit like a stage performance. It was not. The experience is dull and repetitive. That morning was dominated by Stone shooting Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who plays Snowden, looking out of a hotel window. This was meant to be in Hong Kong; Snowden\u2019s bedroom at the Mira hotel having been recreated in Germany. Gordon-Levitt was filmed looking left to right and then down to the street. Over and over again. Different lighting. Different angles. Different shots. The scene makes it into the movie but only lasts a few seconds. It took four hours. When not looking out of glass, Gordon-Levitt was happy to chat. By then, he had already met Edward and was accurately reproducing his slow, precise speech. The son of west coast liberals, he had fostered an intense interest in Snowden and the arguments around surveillance. Unafraid of public declarations of political intent, Gordon-Levitt was preparing to be an advocate for privacy issues in the press commitments ahead. He has already donated his earnings from the movie to the American Civil Liberties Union, one of whose lawyers is Snowden\u2019s chief representative. Watching the shooting in the mocked-up Hong Kong hotel, I spotted on Snowden\u2019s cluttered table an empty can of Tsingtao beer. But there were never any empties in that room. None of us was drinking at the time; Snowden is teetotal. But I didn\u2019t have the heart to mention it because it was already so far into the shooting and the idea of subjecting them to more hours reshooting felt unimaginable. In the end, though, I can\u2019t remember seeing the stubbie in the final cut. There are other, bigger quibbles. Parts of the film are pure Hollywood. Stone devotes much of the movie to the romance between Snowden and Mills. The way Snowden smuggles data out of the NSA headquarters in Hawaii in a Rubik\u2019s Cube is almost certainly the stuff of thriller fantasy. It is also a straightforward biopic, following Snowden from a failed attempt to join US special forces to a successful career as an NSA computer specialist, through disillusionment and then to being a whistleblower. Yet the broad direction of Snowden is more faithful to the truth than might be expected from Hollywood. Stone is quick to insist he is not a political director or an activist, but a dramatist. A surprise to me, maybe to others also familiar with his work. Yet perhaps what he meant was that he does not want to make anything that would be dull. The film isn\u2019t. But I\u2019m an interested party: I\u2019m depicted in it, and so I hope it does well. I\u2019m most interested in the film\u2019s capacity to shift public opinion about the man whose story it portrays. Attitudes in the US tend to be polarised between those who view him as a traitor and those who see him as a hero. Stone\u2019s film can reach people with little prior knowledge. It humanises its subject, makes complex arguments about the balance between privacy and surveillance immediately understandable. Even those who argue that they are not bothered about potential intrusion into the private lives will likely squirm at a scene in which the central couple are having sex \u2013 but then Snowden hesitates, spotting an open laptop, wondering if anyone might be watching through the webcam. (The incident is based on an interview with the Guardian in which Snowden said surveillance agencies do engage in such voyeurism.)\nWill Snowden shift opinion? \u201cI hope so,\u201d Stone says, a touch uncertain. \u201cIt is tricky,\u201d he qualifies. In fact, his film may give some of the more zealous anti-surveillance campaigners pause for thought. One of the more unexpected subtleties in the film comes with its portrayal of the NSA, where differing views about the balance between privacy and security are permitted \u2013 embraced, even. \u201cEd never revealed real people to us,\u201d said Stone. \u201cBut he gave us ideas about real people and events from which we could draw and make \u2013 with dramatic licence \u2013 conclusions that would not be too far-fetched. We tried over many drafts to make it as realistic as possible. \u201cThe NSA have human souls,\u201d he added. \u201cThey are not all James Bond villains.\u201d He was not smiling; he meant it. Yet his own allegiances lie with the whistleblower; his undoubted aim is to caution the unaware about what he calls \u201cthe surveillance state\u201d. \u201cI think we are all facing problems of an Orwellian super\u2013organisation that is running the world,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that is politics!\u201d He is disappointed that the issue has surfaced so little in the US election campaign so far \u2013 its sole appearance at that point was in a Democratic candidates\u2019 debate. Stone backed Bernie Sanders (and is also a fan of Jeremy Corbyn). \u201cHillary Clinton has no mercy in her soul for Snowden,\u201d he says, also murmuring uneasily about her \u201chardcore warmongering tactics\u201d. Snowden will be released in the US two months before a new president is elected, and a day after Stone\u2019s 70th birthday. Its fate will be decided then. But what of the most important opinion, that of Snowden himself? His instinct when he worked at the NSA was to keep a low profile \u2013 presumably he would have been mortified at the prospect of a movie about him. And he remains an essentially private person, happy to talk about technology and surveillance, but guarding details about his own life. The world of the celebrity is not one he would be comfortable with. Stone hints that Snowden liked the movie \u2013 and his cooperatation suggests he is onside. His real pleasure in it, though, may be like mine. In April, the trailer was released. Snowden tweeted: \u201cFor two minutes and 39 seconds, everybody at NSA just stopped working.\u201d His accent is good, if more Edinburgh than my Glasgow glottal stop Ewen MacAskill meets Tom Wilkinson, the man who plays him in Snowden\nAfter seeing the Oscar-winning movie Citizenfour, a Guardian colleague offered up his verdict: \u201cThe guy playing you is rubbish.\u201d It was a joke, I hope; the guy playing me is me, as Citizenfour is a documentary. Released in 2014, Citizenfour recorded a meeting between NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden with three journalists, Laura Poitras, Glenn Greenwald and myself, in Hong Kong in 2013. Oliver Stone\u2019s Snowden is different. Actors take most of the roles, including Tom Wilkinson as me. Throughout my career, I have been comfortable with a low profile, hiding behind print. That has not survived the Snowden story, which has so far spawned three plays, several documentaries and now a Hollywood movie. My part in all of them is relatively small. Even so, the first time I went to see myself played by an actor \u2013 Jonathan Coy, in James Graham\u2019s Privacy at the Donmar Warehouse in 2014 \u2013 I felt a mixture of both embarrassment and dread, not least because I had to write about it. But Coy did a good job and I began to relax after he delivered the first of his lines. I had met the actor before on what I thought was a social occasion \u2013 in fact, he was scoping me, picking up mannerisms.\nIt gave me a strange taste for this strangest experience. When I flew to Munich to visit the set of Snowden, two things were uppermost in my mind. The first: would my small role survive the final cut? The second: would I keep my Scottish accent? Stone might have opted for American, or even English. In a break on set during a thunderstorm, I met the man playing me: Tom Wilkinson. He confirmed he stuck with Scottish. \u201cIt is always an accent I have never had any problems with,\u201d he said. \u201cI am good with accents in a way and Scottish is apparently one of them.\u201d And his accent is good, if a little more Edinburgh than my Glasgow glottal stop. Plus, he refers to Snowden in the movie as \u201claddie\u201d. Not a term I would ever employ. One of the biggest differences between being portrayed on stage and on film is that the language in the play was mine, recorded verbatim, while that in Snowden is invented. At one point in the real meeting in the Mira hotel, Snowden covered himself and his laptop with a red hood. He wanted to hide his password from any hidden cameras, he explained later. Even at the time it seemed odd behaviour and myself and Glenn are caught in Citizenfour exchanging puzzled, uneasy glances. In the movie, I offer up a quip as Snowden pulls the hood over his head, something like, \u201cDo we all get under that?\u201d, which I did not say. Stone repeatedly stressed to me he was making a movie and had to make it interesting. Me just taking notes in a chair, he said kindly, just wasn\u2019t particularly exciting. He needed action. There\u2019s another striking line in which I call the Guardian to tell them that \u201cThe Guinness is good\u201d \u2013 a pre-arranged signal that the whistleblower was genuine, not a crank. In fact, I did say that in real life. And, oddly, it was scripted, the brainchild of then-Guardian US editor Janine Gibson, who is played here by Joely Richardson. The film shows me nodding off. This is accurate, too \u2013 but it happened later than the scenes shown. Neither Glenn, Laura or myself got much sleep for a week. It was only when Snowden went into hiding that I began to relax and started falling asleep all over the place. As for Wilkinson, he was less exercised by the themes behind the film than his director or co-star, but he recalled with excitement the coverage in the Guardian when the story broke, and is sympathetic towards the man. \u201cI don\u2019t think he is a traitor,\u201d he says, quiet and considered. \u201cYou need someone like that. I think all people who put themselves out on a limb to the extent to which he has have a simplicity of outlook that eludes the rest of us.\u201d Earlier in the summer, I saw a preview of the film with my colleague Luke Harding, on whose book much of the movie is based.

His 2008 play Contractions receives its regional premiere at Sheffield\u2019s Studio theatre this month, while his new play, Wild, is at the Hampstead theatre until 16 July. Was Wild inspired by Edward Snowden\u2019s 2013 leaks about US government surveillance? That was the starting point, but almost immediately the play diverges from the facts, and that is deliberate. The moment when I thought: \u201cOoh there\u2019s a\u00a0play there\u201d was literally when Snowden had done it and was in limbo in Russia, without anything to hold on to.

Most people would say not. In banks, in religion, in a sense of nationhood? In each other? Even that has been complicated. It feels like there\u2019s a total collapse of trust, but without trust it\u2019s impossible to have any sense of who one is. You suggest technology and government are in constant tension\u2026 The reason for abandoning the legislation [on superinjunctions] is that technology has made it redundant. If you imagine Twitter like a newspaper, it should be responsible for the content it publishes.

Nearly 200 pages of internal documents that appear to be from Ecuador\u2019s spy agency, the Secretar\u00eda Nacional de Inteligencia, seen by the Guardian, show that information was collected between 2010 and 2013 about bank accounts, debts, the value of people\u2019s cars, foreign travel and partners. The documents, marked secret, include emails, photographs taken at rallies and public meetings, aerial photos of demonstrations and the suspected political and financial links between different groups and individuals. There are also attempts to trace the foreign sources of finance for NGOs and indigenous organisations. Ecuador\u2019s proposal to leave an estimated 846m barrels of oil in the ground under the Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tiputini (ITT) area of the Yasuni national park in the Amazonian rainforest and ask the world to compensate it with half its monetary value was hailed as a revolutionary new idea when it was agreed by president Correa in 2007. The documents suggest that the spies were targeting political groups and individuals seeking to conserve the forest, even though Correa and the government were officially in favour of the plan to keep the oil in the ground, along with most Ecuadorians. People investigated included Alberto Acosta, the former oil minister who, with others, had proposed the idea of leaving the Yasuni oil in the ground in 2006, following the Chevron Texaco pollution disasters in the northern Amazon and indigenous peoples\u2019 successful resistance to oil extraction in the Amazonian community of Sarayaku in the late 1990s.\nAccording to Acosta and other Ecuadorian academics, 40 years of oil exploitation in Ecuador\u2019s Amazon region had led to extreme poverty and inequality which demanded a radical new approach to economics and fossil fuels. But when countries only pledged about $300m (\u00a3190m) by August 2013, Correa reversed his decision, saying the estimated $7bn that the country could eventually earn from the Yasuni oil was needed to alleviate poverty. This prompted mass demonstrations, the formation of a powerful grassroots movement called Yasunidos and a hotly-disputed petition seeking a referendum. Correa was accused of having always intended to extract the Yasuni oil and to have pursued a secret deal with a Chinese oil company. According to presentations reproduced in the documents, the Yasuni incident threatened Ecuador\u2019s sovereignty because the keep it in the ground campaign undermined the state\u2019s authority to act. The documents said that environmentalists wanted to keep indigenous peoples in poverty without access to basic services, health and education and that unnamed multinational businesses were seeking to seize power. \u201cIn future, the [multinationals] plan military intervention in the Amazon basin, privatising these territories and exercising a strategy of control,\u201d says one document.\nThe disclosure of the documents is embarrassing for Correa because, according to leading Quito lawyer Ramiro Avila, under Ecuadorian law personal information is strictly protected from the state and public money cannot be used against the government\u2019s political opponents. \u201cWe have the right to privacy under the constitution. The only way that government can know about the private affairs of a citizen is under the orders of a judge or if they are searching for a crime. That is not the situation here. No authorisation appears to have been given,\u201d said Avila. Juan Falcon\u00ed Puig, Ecuador\u2019s ambassador to the UK, questioned the authenticity of the documents and whether they could be traced back to the Ecuadorian Intelligence Secretariat. \u201cThe problem is to make sure they are authentic,\u201d he said. Several officials of the secretar\u00eda are named as having requested personal information on individuals. According to the documents, surveillance was carried out on individuals including Pedro Delgado, a cousin of Correa and the former president of the central bank, as well as leaders of leftwing and indigenous political parties. Social and environment groups including Ecuarunari, Conaie, Pachacutik, and the Yasunidos were targeted along with international ecology groups Amazon Watch, Oilwatch and Fundaci\u00f3n Pachamama.\nThe documents show a pattern of targeting Correa\u2019s intellectual and political opponents in the media, indigenous movements and parliament. One man considered dangerous by the state is Clever Jimenez who opposed oil exploitation and at the time the report was written had fled the capital city. According to the documents, the \u201chidden\u201d interests of Ecuador\u2019s Communist party is to destabilise government, organise society and take power by way of \u201crevolution\u201d. The spies also identified a cafe in Miami where an unnamed environmentalist used a computer to collect signatures for a national petition against the exploitation of the Yasuni park. One Ecuadorian citizen shown to have been under heavy surveillance is Andr\u00e9s P\u00e1ez, an MP who compiled a list of 172 insults allegedly made by president Correa against named citizens.

The Hacking Team hack, which saw a BitTorrent file of the massive data dump posted to the company\u2019s public twitter feed, contained emails, presentations and source code for its software. The initial effect of the leak was an embarrassing number of revelations about the actions and clients of the firm, which largely provides software for law enforcement and national security to hack into the computers and mobile devices of targets.

The agreement should allow companies to transfer EU citizens\u2019 data for processing or storage within the US, replacing the 2000 that was invalidated by the European court of justice after it ruled the agreement did not have \u201cadequate\u201d privacy protections inline with those of the EU.

In a two-hour session in front of the select committee on national security strategy, the prime minister said that after the next election parliament would need to develop a cross-party consensus in favour of fresh legislation to modernise the way the intelligence services and police monitored communications data. His remarks are both an acknowledgement that current laws are outdated and a determination to return to the issues that were raised in the draft communications bill abandoned by the coalition following protests by the Liberal Democrats. The reference to the next election is likely to be an acknowledgement that he does not think he will be able to reach agreement on the shape of any legislation with his Lib Dem coalition colleagues. The prime minister claimed that the Snowden revelations had damaged UK national security interests, and said newspapers that covered the leaks should think again. In front of the select committee on national security strategy, Cameron also revealed that the cabinet was about to start a discussion of the overseas aid programme, looking at whether some of its budget could be re-focussed on conflict prevention. It is known that the Ministry of Defence sees the review as a way of merging some of its budget with overseas aid. He also said he was very worried at the danger posed by British citizens coming back \"radicalised from Syria\".

It is a politically contentious topic. I am not sure we are going to make progress on it in the coming months in terms of legislation, but there may be things short of legislation that we could do. \"I do think politicians, police chiefs, the intelligence services have got a role in explaining what this is all about. Snowden inevitably raises questions about 'who has access to my data and why'. \"But I am absolutely convinced that proper rules for communication data collection are essential. I do not think we have got across to people yet the absolute basis of this. \"In most of the serious crimes, such as child abduction, comms data \u2013 who called who when and where was the phone at the time, not the content of the call \u2013 the comms data is absolutely vital.\" He continued: \"I love watching crime drama on the television, as I should probably stop telling people. There is hardly a crime drama that is not solved without using the data of a mobile communications device. If we don't modernise the practice and the law over time we will have the communications data to solve these horrible crimes on a shrinking proportion of the total use of the devices. \"That is a real problem for keeping people safe. At the start of the next parliament, we have got to build a cross-party case for legislation to deal with this.\" He said the government should take civil liberties concerns seriously but get them in proportion. He expressed satisfaction that the public was \"unmoved\" by the Guardian revelations, saying: \"I sense the public reaction, as opposed to some of the media reaction, is: 'Look, we have intelligence services because it is a dangerous world and there are people that want to do terrible things.' \" He added: \"I am very worried about the damage that Snowden is doing to our security and I would encourage the newspapers that are endlessly dallying in this to think before they act because we are in severe danger of making ourselves less safe as a result. \"I think the public reaction has not been one of shock horror.

In the past four years, WikiLeaks has had their Twitter accounts secretly spied on, been forced to forfeit most of their funding after credit card companies unilaterally cut them off, had the FBI place an informant inside their news organization, watched their supporters hauled before a grand jury, and been the victim of the UK spy agency GCHQ hacking of their website and spying on their readers.\nNow we\u2019ve learned that, as The Guardian reported on Sunday, the Justice Department got a warrant in 2012 to seize the contents \u2013 plus the metadata on emails received, sent, drafted and deleted \u2013 of three WikiLeaks\u2019 staffers personal Gmail accounts, which was inexplicably kept secret from them for almost two and a half years. The warrant for WikiLeaks staffers\u2019 email is likely connected to the grand jury the government convened in 2010 to investigate the WikiLeaks\u2019 publication of leaked State Department cables, along with the Afghan and Iraq war logs. As The Guardian reports: The warrants were issued by a federal judge in the Eastern District of Virginia \u2013 the same jurisdiction in which a grand jury was set up under the criminal investigation into WikiLeaks. The investigation was confirmed to be still active and ongoing as recently as May last year. [Emphasis mine.] Most journalists and press freedom groups have been inexplicably quiet about the Justice Department\u2019s treatment of WikiLeaks and its staffers ever since, despite the fact that there has been a (justified) backlash against the rest of the Justice Department\u2019s attempt to subpoena reporters\u2019 phone call records and spy on their emails. But almost all of the tactics used against WikiLeaks by the Justice Department in their war on leaks were also used against mainstream news organizations. For example, after the Washington Post revealed in 2013 the Justice Department had gotten a warrant for the personal Gmail account of Fox News reporter James Rosen in 2010 without his knowledge by explicitly accusing him of being an espionage \u201cco-conspirator\u201d (for have the audacity to arrange to confidentially speak with a source), journalists and privacy advocates understandably reacted in shock and outrage. WikiLeaks staffers faced virtually the same tactics: they had their Gmail seized by the government in secret, they didn\u2019t find out for years after the fact (so they had no way to challenge it) and, according to WikiLeaks\u2019 lawyers, the warrant specifically indicates the Justice Department is investigating WikiLeaks for \u201cconspiracy to commit espionage.\u201d Former New York Times general counsel James Goodale wrote in 2011 how ridiculous and dangerous a charge like \u2018conspiracy to commit espionage\u2019 was, whether it was directed at WikiLeaks or the New York Times: Charging Assange with \u201cconspiracy to commit espionage\u201d would set a precedent with a charge that more accurately could be characterized as \u201cconspiracy to commit journalism.\u201d Unfortunately the news world has never rallied around WikiLeaks\u2019 First Amendment rights they way they should \u2013 sometimes even refusing to acknowledge they are a journalism organization, perhaps because they dare to do things a little differently than the mainstream media, or because WikiLeaks tweets provocative political opinions, or because they think its founder, Julian Assange, is an unsympathetic figure. Those are all disgraceful excuses to ignore the government\u2019s overreach: the rights of news organizations everywhere are under just as much threat whether the government reads the private emails of staffers at WikiLeaks, Fox News or the Associated Press. In the eyes of the law, the organizations are virtually indistinguishable, as legal scholars from across the political spectrum have documented for years. At the same time WikiLeaks\u2019s legal troubles have been largely brushed off by the journalism world, the Justice Department has continued to treat them with contempt, ignoring their own guidelines for issuing search warrants and subpoenas to journalists publishing leaked materials and pressing ahead with all-out surveillance of a news publisher. Just imagine if the FBI placed a paid informant inside the New York Times: there would be protests on the steps of the Justice Department the next day. Years after they first started publishing, the WikiLeaks State Department cables still remain critical to journalists all over the world (they featured prominently in the New York Times front-page obituary of King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia just this week, for instance). Yet the vast criminal investigation into WikiLeaks for publishing them at all has received scant condemnation, despite the clear dangers. And, despite the ongoing legal pressure, WikiLeaks has continued to publish important documents in the public interest. In 2014, they published draft texts of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement that has been vigorously opposed by a variety of public interest groups because of the extreme secrecy around the treaty\u2019s negotiations. And in December, they published a secret CIA study showing the negative effects of the US government\u2019s policy of targeted killing in Afghanistan and other places. The Justice Department in the past few months has commendably seemed to retreat, at least temporarily, from its much-maligned assault on journalism.

Speaking on the ABC\u2019s Q&A program on Monday night, the attorney general appeared to contradict previous interpretations of the legislation. \u201cIf it is a journalist covering what a whistleblower has disclosed, then the journalist wouldn\u2019t fall within the reach of the section because the relevant conduct is the conduct constituting the disclosure, so if the event is already disclosed by someone else and a journalist merely reports that which has already been disclosed, as it was by Snowden, then the provision would not be attracted,\u201d Brandis said. The government\u2019s explanatory notes, attached to the bill, said the new offences prohibited the disclosure of information relating to a special intelligence operation \u201cincluding publication of such information\u201d. They applied to disclosures \u201cby any person\u201d including \u201cthe recipients of an unauthorised disclosure of information should they engage in any subsequent disclosure\u201d. Brandis said last week the section 35P disclosure provisions were \u201cprimarily, in fact, intended to deal with a Snowden-type situation\u201d. Brandis has been highly critical of Snowden\u2019s actions in leaking intelligence material to the Guardian and other news outlets. In February, Brandis said Snowden was a \u201ctraitor\u201d who \u201csatisfies none of the tests of a whistleblower\u201d. The laws carry maximum jail terms of five or 10 years, depending on whether lives were endangered. Brandis declined to comment directly on the hypothetical application of the new laws to last year\u2019s revelations by Guardian Australia and the ABC that Australia spies had targeted the Indonesian president\u2019s phone. Brandis and the AFP assistant commissioner, Neil Gaughan, also rejected claims that September\u2019s counter-terrorism raids in Sydney were \u201cover the top\u201d. Gaughan signalled the AFP\u2019s intention to carry out further raids that might result in relatively few arrests. Asked about the joint AFP and NSW police operation, which involved 800 officers but resulted in only one terrorism charge, Gaughan said he made no apology for acting on \u201ccredible information suggesting a terrorist attack was imminent\u201d. \u201cWhat we will see now is more raids like we saw in Sydney, because the environment has changed,\u201d said Gaughan, the AFP\u2019s counter-terrorism national manager. \u201cThe paradigm has changed such that we will be forced to react much quicker than what we previously have, and I think that the community will see more of this where we will do a large number of execution of search warrants and probably only one or two arrests.\u201d Gaughan said police had \u201ca large number of ongoing investigations\u201d and would \u201ccontinue to act appropriately for public safety reasons\u201d. Brandis said the raids, codenamed Operation Appleby were \u201cnot over the top and it was not overreach\u201d because it was in response to \u201cspecific actionable intelligence that an individual was imminently about to commit a terrorist crime \u2026 an act of lethal violence here in Sydney\u201d. The program, broadcast from Bankstown in south-western Sydney, was dominated by discussion of the government\u2019s changes to national security laws, including criminalising travel to declared international no-go zones without a legitimate purpose. Islamic community representatives raised concerns that the laws targeted Muslims and eroded civil liberties, and that the government\u2019s rhetoric had the effect of dividing Australians. Brandis said law enforcement agencies would \u201cbe entirely blind\u201d to the culture, religion or ethnicity of of alleged offenders, but would be driven by whether a crime was committed. He said predators were preying on Muslims in Australia in an attempt to \u201censnare and cajole\u201d them to fight in Iraq and Syria. Security agencies believed 71 Australians were fighting there, Brandis said, and more than 20 had returned. \u201cWe know that 15 young Australians have been killed, two of them have been suicide bombers in that civil war,\u201d he said. Brandis said the government had cancelled the passports of 73 people to prevent them going to Syria and northern Iraq to join the conflicts. One audience member asked how she could feel safe in the knowledge that those people with cancelled passports remained in Australia. Brandis said Australia had an international obligation under a UN security council resolution passed in September to prevent the travel of foreign fighters, but hinted that those people whose travel documents had been revoked would remain under surveillance. \u201cThe reason there were grounds [to cancel the passports] is because they were known to the authorities,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom the fact that they were known to the authorities, you should be reassured that the authorities have their eyes on these people and are going to ensure that they don\u2019t do harm.\u201d\n", "title": "George Brandis says laws would not catch journalists reporting Edward Snowden leaks"}, {"date": "2015-10-16T12:15:28Z", "body": "American whistleblowers hailed the release on Thursday of a collection of classified documents about US drone warfare as a blow on behalf of transparency and human rights. The documents anchored a multi-part report by the Intercept on the Defense Department assassination program in Yemen and Somalia. Amnesty International, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and other rights groups said the report raised significant concerns about human rights violations by the US government, and called for an investigation. Classified documents published by the Intercept include pages from a 2013 study of the drone program by a Pentagon taskforce. The documents came from \u201ca source within the intelligence community who worked on the types of operations and programs described in the slides\u201d, the Intercept said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty remarkable stuff,\u201d said Micah Zenko, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cIn some ways it reconfirms and illuminates much of what we knew, or thought we knew, about a lot of these programs, like that the administration firmly prefers kill over capture despite claiming the opposite, and that there\u2019s not \u2018a bunch of folks in the room\u2019, as Obama calls it \u2013 that there\u2019s a clear, bureaucratic process for this. \u201cIt clearly shows, as we\u2019ve known, that the United States does not know who it\u2019s killing.\u201d The White House and National Security Council declined to comment on the leak. \u201cThe report the Intercept story references is an internal classified document,\u201d said Pentagon spokeswoman Linda Rojas. \u201cAs a matter of policy we don\u2019t comment on the details of classified reports.\u201d The CIA maintains a drone assassination program separate from the Pentagon program, although Barack Obama has called for bringing the CIA program inside the Defense Department. That effort has stalled. The Intercept report revealed, among other new disclosures, that at one point in 2012 Obama had approved 20 people for assassination in Yemen and Somalia. More than 200 were killed by drones in those countries that year, according to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism. It revealed that the military labels unidentified people it kills in targeted strikes as \u201cenemies killed in action\u201d, although victims may be family members or associates of actual targets \u2013 or may just have been nearby, or mistakenly targeted. Edward Snowden, the former government contractor who in 2013 leaked classified documents about surveillance programs to journalist Glenn Greenwald \u2013 then at the Guardian, now at the Intercept \u2013 hailed the new leak on Twitter. \u201cIn an astonishing act of civil courage, one American just shattered an unspeakable lie,\u201d Snowden wrote. \u201cWhen we look back on today, we will find the most important national security story of the year. Today, @DanielEllsberg is smiling.\u201d\nEllsberg, who in 1971 leaked the Pentagon Papers secret history of the Vietnam war, confirmed in an interview with the Guardian that he was smiling. \u201cHe\u2019s right about that,\u201d Ellsberg said. Ellsberg said the source behind the Intercept reports was part of a chain of recent whistleblowers going back to Chelsea Manning, the US army soldier who passed classified documents to WikiLeaks and was convicted of violating the Espionage Act. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful,\u201d Ellsberg said. \u201cI waited 40 years to see somebody, for Chelsea Manning, to put out a comprehensive, sufficiently voluminous number of long-held secrets, enough to make the case clear. \u201cI waited 40 years for Chelsea. Three more for Snowden. And so it\u2019s wonderful that somebody is telling the truth about this series of crimes. I\u2019m very glad to see it.\u201d In a Democracy Now interview Jeremy Scahill, the lead author of the Intercept reports, called the source an \u201cextremely principled and brave whistleblower\u201d. Zenko said the locus of the source was \u201chard to know\u201d, because \u201cthere\u2019s just such a crossover between the intelligence community and the military anyway\u201d. \u201cAs we know, to keep one Predator [unmanned aerial vehicle] aloft, you need like 130 people, and most of them are just looking at video screens and doing analysis of the collection that that drone does,\u201d Zenko said. \u201cThere\u2019s so many people running these programs.\u201d Ellsberg said of the source: \u201cI hope they stay anonymous. Nothing at all would be gained by their suffering the fate of exile like Snowden [who now lives in Russia], or isolation or imprisonment like Chelsea [who was given a 35-year jail term]. Or the life sentences that I faced, or that others have faced. \u201cIt comes down to this. Hundreds could have done what I did, literally. And should have. Hundreds of people could and should have done what Edward Snowden did. And hundreds of people could and should have done what Chelsea Manning did. \u201cThey did the right thing.

The crime he\u2019s accused of? Telling the American public the very truth that forced Congress to restrict, rather than expand, the spy agency\u2019s power for the first time in over forty years. The passage of the USA Freedom Act is quite simply a vindication of Edward Snowden, and it\u2019s not just civil libertarians who have noticed: he\u2019s forced even some of the most establishment-friendly commentators to change their opinions of his actions. But it\u2019s a shame that almost everyone nonetheless ignores the oppressive law under which Snowden was charged or the US government\u2019s outrageous position in his case: that if he were to stand trial, he could not tell the jury what his whistleblowing has accomplished. The White House told reporters on Thursday that, despite the imminent passage of NSA reform, they still believe Edward Snowden still belongs in prison (presumably for life, given his potential charges), while at the same time, brazenly taking credit for the USA Freedom Act passing, saying that \u201chistorians\u201d would consider it part of Obama\u2019s \u201clegacy.\u201d Hopefully historians will also remember, as Ryan Lizza adeptly documented in the New Yorker, that Obama was handed every opportunity to reform the NSA before Edward Snowden, yet behind the scenes repeatedly refused to do so. Instead, the Obama administration was dragged kicking and screaming across the finish line by Snowden\u2019s disclosures, all while engaging in fear-mongering that would make Dick Cheney proud.\nSnowden is now the most influential whistleblower of his generation. Even his biggest detractors, the same people who once all but refused to utter his name, have recently had to concede his influence. Take, for example, this amusing article at the Huffington Post quoting various Senators across the political spectrum who were forced to begrudgingly admit that they wouldn\u2019t even be having the debate over reforming the NSA\u2019s surveillance practices if it wasn\u2019t for Snowden. You can almost hear the contempt coming out of their mouths as you read their reactions. Sadly, even those in Congress who were campaigning for stronger NSA reform than the bill that passed the Senate are afraid to directly credit Snowden and, in many cases, still condemn him. Some cling to the erroneous belief that Snowden should come back to the US if he\u2019s really a whistleblower because he could \u201ctell his story to a jury.\u201d But since he was charged under the draconian Espionage Act \u2013 a World War I-era statute meant for spies, not leakers \u2013 Snowden would not even be able to utter the word \u201cwhistleblower\u201d in court, let alone tell a jury why he did what he did. Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg explained in great detail how any evidence Snowden wanted to bring up to a judge would be ruled inadmissible, thanks to the incredibly restrictive way the Espionage Act is written. And don\u2019t kid yourselves when the White House talks about bringing Snowden to \u201cjustice\u201d; his case has never been about \u201cjustice\u201d when it comes to leaking government secrets to journalists. As US officials have shown repeatedly over the last year, they will happily leak classified details to newspapers more sensitive than what Snowden leaked if it means glorifying and defending their policies. Glenn Greenwald noted late last month that so many politicians and pundits in Washington DC seem to dislike Snowden not because what he leaked, but because he was able to shift the dominant narrative about national security away from the all-fear-all-the-time norm that so dominated in Washington for the last decade. Establishment DC, by and large, still hates him because he has continued to not only participate, but thrive in the debate about US national security, despite being exiled from his home country. How he managed to do so is remarkable in itself: thanks to technology, Snowden can appear at Princeton one day and Sweden the next and comment on the day\u2019s news and developments, instead of being gagged from speaking to the press like Chelsea Manning was while she was tortured, awaiting her court martial. Snowden is cracking jokes on Reddit instead of rotting in solitary confinement at a maximum security prison. Without Edward Snowden, there would be no debate about the mass surveillance of Americans by the NSA. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals would not have ruled such surveillance illegal, tech companies would not encrypt our phone calls and text messages, and Congress certainly would not have passed the USA Freedom Act - no matter how meager its reforms actually are. Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which the NSA used to secretly vacuum up every American\u2019s phone records, would have been renewed in a landslide with little fanfare \u2013 it always was in the past \u2013 and the American people would have been none the wiser. But there also might have not been an Edward Snowden if it wasn\u2019t for the whistleblowers who risked it all before him. Lost in the national discussion about Snowden\u2019s leaks and NSA reforms has been the US government\u2019s deplorable treatment of the NSA whistleblowers who came before Snowden: Thomas Drake, Bill Binney, J Kirk Wiebe, Diane Roark and others. They were investigated, had their phones wiretapped, were pulled out of their houses at gunpoint, and in one case, was charged under the Espionage Act for internally protesting the NSA\u2019s illegal and unconstitutional actions after 9/11. The USA Freedom Act vote was just as much vindication for those men and women whose lives were destroyed for telling the truth but who never became household names. It is an ongoing travesty that the Espionage Act \u2013 a bill meant to punish spies who sell secrets to foreign governments \u2013 can be used in such a vindictive and draconian way against someone who wanted to hand the truth to the American people. Snowden told the Guardian two weeks ago that he saw the USA Freedom Act as the beginning and not the end of NSA reform. Hopefully Congress will one day soon also have the courage to give whistleblowers their normally-guaranteed right to defend themselves in court, and not send them to straight to jail or worse.\n", "title": "Snowden's leaks forced NSA reform on Congress.

As investigative journalist Duncan Campbell described in the Intercept yesterday, in a compelling account of a life spent chasing Britain\u2019s spies out of the shadows, in the 70s and 80s even talking about GCHQ, let alone investigating and reporting on it, could get you followed, arrested and jailed. We\u2019ve come a long way; not only is GCHQ namechecked in the news on a daily basis (thanks in large part to Edward Snowden), but for the past year it has been on a charm offensive, trying to revive its tarnished reputation.\nThe degree of transparency that exists around US and UK secret surveillance agencies NSA and GCHQ exists in large part due to the tenacity of Campbell and his contemporaries; it was Campbell who wrote the first ever story about GCHQ, revealed the existence of NSA spying outpost Menwith Hill in North Yorkshire (now a global centre for planned cyberwar), exposed the construction of a British spy satellite, Zircon, and reported on the deployment of mass-communications surveillance practices by the British government. It is hard to underestimate the impact that the work of Campbell and other investigative journalists had on the evolution of law and accountability around British spy agencies. Without a doubt, the stories published by journalists working on NSA and GCHQ surveillance have acted as catalysts for legislation, parliamentary inquiries, resignations and greater public scrutiny of the acts committed by intelligence agencies across the world in the name of democracy and national security.\nOne of the most prominent of Campbell\u2019s modern-day heirs \u2013 and most robust defenders of his legacy \u2013 is German news site Netzpolitik. In news that shocked its vocal and passionate community of internet supporters, it was revealed last week that Netzpolitik reporters and co-founders Markus Beckedahl and Andre Meister had been placed under investigation for treason by Germany\u2019s federal attorney general, Harald Range. Their crime? Publishing details about surveillance programmes operated by the German secret service. A recipient of numerous awards, Netzpolitik is one of the most well-regarded German-language news blogs, and has been tirelessly reporting on technology, digital rights and politics since 2002. Netzpolitik has been at the forefront of the coverage of the Snowden revelations. The organisation for which I work, Privacy International, has also conducted a joint investigation with the site, exposing how the Ethiopian government purchased German-made surveillance technologies to spy on its citizens. The Ethiopian government has reportedly told the BBC: \u201cThis is nothing new to respond to\u201d. We know Beckedahl and Meister to be dynamic and dedicated reporters with high journalistic ethics.\nPutting aside the absurd contention that a digital news site could be responsible for seriously prejudicing the national security of Germany \u2013 as Meister asserted, \u201cGermany won\u2019t be invaded because of our reporting\u201d \u2013 this prosecution raised serious concerns about the future of investigative reporting in an era of increasing state surveillance. It is all the more worrying that this is happening in Germany, a country with a recent record of promoting greater accountability for the exercise of surveillance powers. In a welcome sign of cooler heads prevailing, Angela Merkel \u2013 who herself reported that she was put under unlawful surveillance \u2013 supported the decision to suspend the investigation pending an external assessment, as well as the justice minister\u2019s decision to sack Range, the attorney general responsible. Nevertheless, the head of German intelligence services Hans-Georg Maassen, has defended the idea of criminal prosecution of journalists for investigative reporting. Preventing the publication of secret or classified documents is necessary \u201cto continue the fight against extremism and terrorism,\u201d Maassen said, using the same justification offered in June for the surveillance of children\u2019s internet usage in British schools. There appear to be no limits to what governments will seek to do under the pretext of countering terrorism.

The two amendments tabled by the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, do not strike at the central powers contained in the planned emergency laws, but reflect anger at the way in which the potentially sweeping changes are being railroaded through parliament even though their interpretation remains in dispute between experts. Cooper said: \"The government should not have left this legislation until the last minute before the summer and they should have engaged much earlier in a serious public debate about what powers should be available to the police and security services and what safeguards are needed for privacy \u2013 as President Obama has done in the US since the Snowden leaks last year. By ducking the debate and leaving things to the last they are undermining trust.\" Campaigners have rejected assurances given by the home secretary, Theresa May, and Nick Clegg that the emergency laws merely restore the powers that the security services had before a European court of justice (ECJ) ruling in April struck down an EU directive. The Home Office had relied on the directive to intercept data and require phone companies to hand over details of phone calls, but not their content. Clegg met his parliamentarians to brief them on the bill's contents, which are due to be rushed through the Commons in one day on Tuesday, then through the Lords in the two following days. The deputy prime minister has won the influential support of Lord Macdonald, the former director of public prosecutions. A Liberal Democrat peer, Macdonald has a record of criticising the government on civil liberties issues, but said: \"Personally on this one I think the NGOs, like Liberty, have called it wrong. \"I don't think the bill extends the intelligence agencies' remit beyond what it was before the ECJ judgment.\" He also rejected suggestions that foreign-based communication service providers offering services in the UK were in practice being required to hand over new data to the state. Macdonald said: \"This is what the foreign service providers did anyway informally on a nod and a wink basis and they would prefer for this to be on a clear statutory basis. \"It is absolutely clear from my experience that there is no doubt we need this information. There was almost no serious case in my time that did not rely on this kind of data. We need to get back to where we were before the ECJ case. \"It is important to remember the two wins from this. There will be a review of Ripa [the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act], something people like me have been calling for years. We have been banging our heads against a brick wall about this. Secondly, we will have the privacy and liberties oversight board of the kind that Obama has. These are reforms I had not expected to see.\" The bill is due to complete all its Commons stages with support from all three main frontbenches. Only a few MPs are likely to abstain or vote against, leaving campaigners to focus on the Lords to see if any concessions or clarifications can be extracted. The digital expert Lady Lane-Fox is expected to be one of those to warn about the bill's implications. The Labour MP for Birmingham Small Heath, Roger Godsiff, accused the government of trying to bounce parliament into accepting a snooper's charter \"in a ridiculously short period of time\" that \"could be used to intrude into the lives of everybody in this country\". Giving hasty evidence to the home affairs select committee, May said the powers forcing overseas companies to comply with British intercept warrants have always been regarded within government circles as authorised under existing\u00a0 legislation. The requirement on overseas companies to comply with British intercept warrants was included in Ripa, she said. She also claimed the same 14-year-old legislation authorised the enforced collection of personal communications data from \"a wide range of providers\" of internet and phone services. May told the committee: \"In relation to lawful intercept, it is the case that it has always been regarded, from government circles certainly, that Ripa had an ability to operate extra-territorially, ie to serve warrant on a provider that's overseas, and that there was a wide range of providers that came under the definition of Ripa. \"This has been questioned, and we feel it's appropriate to, therefore, put that beyond doubt in terms of legislating. But these are powers and capabilities that exist today, that are used today. This is not about extending those to any new remit.\" May declined when she was repeatedly pressed by a Lib Dem, Julian Huppert, to say how many overseas companies had complied the requirement to hand over personal internet and phone material. May told MPs that the \"extra-territoriality powers\" contained in clause four of the six-clause bill were designed to \"put beyond legal doubt\" the power to \"serve an intercept warrant overseas\" while those in clause five, which extended the definition of communications data to include webmail and other new forms, simply confirmed that \"a wide range of providers\" had always been covered by the legislation. Liberty, Privacy International and other campaign groups have warned in a briefing to MPs that these \"extra-territorial\" powers could provide the legal basis for enabling a number of Tempora-style programmes around the world. Documents leaked by Edward Snowden disclosed that GCHQ has been tapping into transatlantic fibre-optic cables and storing huge amounts of data for up to 30 days under its Tempora programme.\n", "title": "Yvette Cooper tables amendments to controversial surveillance legislation"}, {"date": "2014-06-23T06:31:14Z", "body": "Australian spy agencies will be granted new digital surveillance powers under a bill being prepared by the Abbott government, expected to be introduced into parliament in July.

The reforms will reportedly be in line with recommendations made by the federal government\u2019s joint committee on intelligence and security in May 2013, aimed at updating Australian surveillance laws in line with the \u201ccontemporary communications environment\u201d. Plans to boost digital surveillance powers were drafted before the latest outbreak of sectarian violence in Iraq. But the prime minister, Tony Abbott, said the new measures would help counter the threat posed by up to 300 Australians who have flocked to the region to fight with the Sunni extremist group, the Islamic State in Iraq and Levant (Isis) \u201cWe\u2019ve stopped the illegal boats; we will ensure we stop the jihadists as well,\u201d Abbott said on Monday. \u201cThe last thing we want is people who have been radicalised and militarised by experience with these al-Qaida offshoots in the Middle East \u2026 returning to create mischief in Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s important to ensure that our police and security services have the means at their disposal to ensure our community is safe.\u201d Among the recommendations made by the committee in its May 2013 report was that the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation (Asio) be given new powers to \u201cdisrupt\u201d target computers that pose a risk to national security; to monitor the entire network on which a target computer is hosted; to use a \u201cthird party\u201d computer as a gateway to access to a suspicious computer or network. The committee found that a mandatory data retention scheme, which would see telecommunication providers secure their customers\u2019 data for use by law enforcement for up to two years, would be of \u201csignificant utility\u201d to spy agencies. But it said any such regime would raise \u201cfundamental privacy issues\u201d and \u201ccivil liberties concerns\u201d that needed to be addressed, it said. \u201cThere is a diversity of views within the committee as to whether there should be a mandatory data retention regime.

The attorney-general at the time, Mark Dreyfus, shelved the proposed scheme before the 2013 federal election, saying he would await further advice and \u201ccomprehensive consultation\u201d. But the deputy opposition leader, Tanya Plibersek, signalled her support for mandatory data retention in March, reasoning that metadata gave access only to the \u201cenvelope\u201d, not the contents. \u201cPeople describe it as keeping the haystack so you can go back and look for the needle afterwards,\u201d she said. Plibersek also backed reforms to digital surveillance laws more broadly. \u201cThere continue to be threats. Those threats may increase,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cI want to give [intelligence] agencies the maximum ability to do their job well, within the bounds that people would expect.\u201d At least one internet service provider opposes mandatory data retention; iiNet\u2019s chief regulatory officer, Steve Dalby, told an inquiry in 2012 the company had \u201csincere misgivings about the principle of non-stop intelligence gathering on innocent members of the community who are never \u2018persons of interest\u2019 in the law-enforcement sense\u201d. Dalby also questioned the cost of retaining such a high volume of data, suggesting it would add $3m a month to iiNet\u2019s expenses, which would likely be passed on to customers. The Law Council has also expressed \u201cgrave concerns\u201d. Phillip Boulten SC, from the council\u2019s criminal law committee, told a Senate inquiry in April that \u201cholding that sort of data for, say, two years will seriously jeopardise privacy concerns, and lead to extraordinary costs for internet service providers\u201d. The Greens senator Scott Ludlam, who successfully moved a Senate inquiry into telecommunications interception late last year, said he was \u201creluctant to comment\u201d until the government presented parliament with draft legislation. \u201cI think everyone needs to be a bit careful because the debate is proceeding by way of leaks to the Daily Telegraph, rather than by way of sensible proposals or formal proposals,\u201d Ludlam said. \u201cI don't think that's the appropriate way to deal with issues of such importance.\u201d The attorney general, George Brandis, has been contacted for comment.\n", "title": "Australian spy agencies in line for new digital surveillance powers"}, {"date": "2014-07-10T16:03:56Z", "body": "\u2022 Kenny MacAskill, justice secretary in the SNP-led Scottish government, has said he is \"disappointed\" that the UK government did not consult with Edinburgh before announcing its plans for an emergency surveillance bill. He said he was \"disappointed at the lack of prior consultation and discussion from UK government on today's announcement given how much this legislation potentially impinges on areas of Scots law that are clearly devolved and under the jurisdiction of the Scottish Government or our law enforcement agencies, including the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service.\" \u2022 Ed Miliband's decision to back the bill has been criticised by some in his party. Tom Watson MP said he was \"very disappointed\" by the move. He added: To allow this to go through with such unnecessary haste is not just anti-democratic, but I think it\u2019s a political mistake for the Labour party. And the Labour Campaign for Human Rights has issued a statement saying more time should be set aside to allow MPs to debate the bill properly. We need time to address these questions. MPs need time to understand and scrutinise what is being proposed. If this is simply rushed through, the public will suspect an establishment \u201cstich-up\u201d, which will in turn undermine confidence in the security services. LCHR would like to see the passage of this bill delayed to allow time for a proper debate. This is an important issue for Labour. We must show people that today\u2019s Labour Party can be trusted to responsibly balance privacy and security. That\u2019s why we need more time to look at these proposals. \u2022 Miliband has defended his decision to back the bill. In a statement he said: My first and fundamental duty is to ensure the security and safety of our citizens. I am convinced major investigations into terrorism and organised crime would be jeopardised if we don't pass legislation and that would jeopardise the security and safety of our citizens. That's why I believe legislation is necessary. I also believe that we need to ensure that we protect the liberty of our citizens as well as their security and that's why I'm pleased that the Government has agreed that for the first time there is cross-party support for an independent review of all of these issues.\" Labour sources have also been saying that it was Labour that insisted on a review of surveillance legislation reporting before the election as a conditon for the party backing the bill. \u2022 Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, the commissioner of the Metropolitan police, has welcomed the bill. This is what he told the London Assembly. All we're trying to do is to maintain the level of surveillance that we've already got. If we don't do this we lose it, and it's vital. It's vital not only to counter-terrorism operations but particularly to serious crime. At some levels it geniunely helps us save lives, for example if we have kidnaps it's a vital thing that we need, it's also important in homicide investigations. If we lose it - and there's some danger that we are already losing it - then we will all be less safe. Here's my lunchtime summary, with earlier developments. That's all from me for today. Thanks for the comments.\nSubhajit Basu, an associate professor in information technology law (aka \"cyberlaw\") at Leeds University, has sent me a comment about the way the bill extends the definition of a communications service provider (CSP). See 2.53pm and 4.24pm. He says the bill is \"far more intrusive\" than the government is suggesting and that it will \"expand the jurisdiction of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act\". As I understand this, the proposed new legislation will cover all persons and all means of electronic communication. It extends the type of communication service provider. It is not subject to geographic restriction. It remains to be seen if a CSP would include Wi-Fi cafe or an unsecured router. Because of this bill, law enforcement authorities can ask Google to decrypt the content (with a warrant - they were able to do it before in the same way), not just Google UK but 'any' company based outside the jurisdiction of UK.\nThe Home Office explanatory notes to the bill are available here (pdf). They explain in some detail why, in addition to introducing data retention rules in the light of the European court of justice ruling, the bill is also amending the Regulation of Investigatory Power Act. This Bill is required in order to clarify the intent of RIPA. While RIPA has always had implicit extraterritorial effect, some companies based outside the United Kingdom, including some of the largest communications providers in the market, have questioned whether the legislation applies to them. These companies argue that they will only comply with requests where there is a clear obligation in law ... The need to clarify the intent of RIPA reflects the increasingly globalised nature of telecommunications. This makes it vital that overseas companies comply with lawful requests made under RIPA. Since RIPA was enacted, there is a greater expectation that where Parliament intends a statute to apply extra-territorially, it will contain explicit provision to that effect. This has resulted in telecommunications companies, which this Bill clarifies includes those that provide internet-based services, such as webmail, questioning whether RIPA can apply to them in the absence of explicit statutory confirmation that it applies extra- territorially. If this clarification is not dealt with quickly, there is an increasing likelihood that we could see telecommunications companies refusing requests which are critical for national security and the fight against serious crime. The notes also confirm that the bill is extending the definition of a communications service provider, as rustyschwinnToo pointed out earlier. (See 2.53pm.) It is important to clarify urgently the definition of a \u201ctelecommunications service\u201d to ensure it captures the range of services that are used by terrorists and criminals in their attack planning and criminal activities ... This clause inserts a new subsection into section 2 of RIPA. New section 2(8A) makes clear that the definition of \u201ctelecommunications service\u201d includes companies who provide internet-based services, such as webmail.\nDavid Allen Green, the lawyer and legal blogger, says the data retention bill allows the government to make new laws about data retention.\nOn the World at One David Davis, the Conservative MP, said the Home Office should have allowed more time for the bill to be debated. I couldn\u2019t see quite what there was of an emergency here beyond a sort of theatrical emergency. Bear in mind that it was passed through the European court on 8 April, but that didn\u2019t come out of a blue sky \u2013 there was a submission to it by an Austrian province called Carinthia some time before that, so they should have been prepared for it. Any competent department of state would have looked at the options, look why it might go through, what might be struck down and so on, had legislation prepared then, and we would have then had three months up until now to consider what we should do, rather than this thing that\u2019s going through in a single day \u2013 extraordinarily unusual. Davis said that he did not accept David Cameron's claims that the government had to act urgently. And he said that that the sunset clause in the bill should make it lapse after six months, not allow it to stay in force until 2016. If you really wanted to debate this properly, what we should have done is had a sunset clause in six months. If they\u2019d done that, I would have said \u2018fine \u2013 have whatever bill you like; we can debate it in the autumn, take our time, prepare our data, look at the evidence, look at the law carefully and then get a properly worked-up law before Christmas\u2019. But they didn\u2019t do that. You can listen to the full interview here.\nLabour's Diane Abbott is unhappy about the bill being rushed through parliament.\nHuman Rights Watch has criticised the government for rushing this bill through parliament. This is from Izza Leghtas, a Human Rights Watch researcher. Given what we know about the UK's involvement in mass surveillance, it is outrageous that the government wants to rush through emergency legislation that allows the government to monitor people not suspected of any wrongdoing. A proper debate about how to reform surveillance powers is long overdue and it has to happen now, not in 2016.\nLabour is saying that, as one of the conditions for it supporting the emergency data retention bill, it insisted that the surveillance review (see 2pm) had to produce a report before the general election. Here are the terms of reference of the review, which David Anderson, the government's independent reviewer of terror legislation, will lead. To review the legislation governing the use of communications data and lawful intercept, including the regulation of the investigatory powers act, with particular regard to the following issues: \u2022 Whether the current legislation is sufficient to address current and future threats and whether the safeguards to protect privacy are sufficient, given the challenges of current and future technologies and capability requirements \u2022 Whether the current arrangements for accessing and using data - content and metadata - are necessary, proportionate and have appropriate safeguards \u2022 How the different levels of safeguards and limits for domestic and foreign intelligence apply in light of communication technologies which send domestic messages via international servers \u2022 Whether the different levels of safeguards and limits for domestic and foreign intelligence remain sufficient \u2022 Whether there is a case to be made for making the legislation simpler or more coherent \u2022 Whether existing statistical and transparency requirements should be strengthened \u2022 The effectiveness of current statutory oversight arrangements - including the operational of commissioners and the administrative and resource impact of these The review will take account of the findings of the Joint Committee on the draft Communications Bill, RUSI review, the ISC Privacy and Security Inquiry. The review will produce an interim report on its findings by the end of this Parliament, with a view to publication of its final report after the 2015 election.\nIn the comments rustyschwinnToo says the bill may be extending the definition of a communications service provider.\nI will try to get an expert assessment of this.\n\u2022 David Cameron has said that failing to pass emergency surveillance legislation published today would increase the chances of Britain being hit by a terrorist attack. At a news conference where he and Nick Clegg defended the data retention and investigation powers bill, which will be rushed through parliament next week with cross-party support (because Labour back it too), Cameron said: We face real and credible threats to our security from serious and organised crime, from the activity of paedophiles, from the collapse of Syria, the growth of Isis in Iraq and al Shabab in East Africa. I am simply not prepared to be a prime minister who has to address the people after a terrorist incident and explain that I could have done more to prevent it. In a statement about the bill in the Commons, Theresa May, the home secretary, also explicitly said, twice, that lives could be lost if MPs failed to pass the legislation. \u2022 Cameron indicated that he wanted to revive the so-called \"snoopers' charter\" after the general election. At his press conference, and in his news release, he stressed the limited scope of today's bill. But, at the news conference, he also said that in the future more wide-ranging legislation was needed. The time to debate what more we might need to do, we've agreed, is for the future. My own very strong view is that we need to ask ourselves this simple question: Do we want as a country to leave a means of communications for paedophiles, terrorists and other serious criminals to communicate with each other than in extremis we cannot intercept. My own view is that, No, we don't. Governments up to now have always taken the view, whether it's to do with the mail, whether it's to do with fixed telephony, whether it's to do with mobile phones, that in extremis, to keep the country safe, there are occasions when you need to be able to intercept those communications. I believe that, as technology develops, we will have, over time, to do more to make sure that we don't give paedophiles, terrorists and criminals another way of communicating that we can't, in extremis, intercept. But that debate is for the future. That debate is not for today. Today is simply about maintaining the existing capabilities that we have. \u2022 David Anderson, the government's independent reviewer of terror legislation, is to chair a wide-ranging review of surveillance legislation. Alongside the data retention bill, the government has also announced a series of new measures \"to increase transparency and oversight\", including a review covering the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act. May told MPs Anderson would led this, that he would produce a report before the election (to help the next government legislate) and that he would get the resources he needed to enable him to do the job properly. The Lib Dems and Labour have also welcomed this review, but it is clear that different parties have different expectations. The Tories want the review to pave the way for a revival of the \"snoopers' charter\" (see above). The Lib Dems, by contrast, hope it will safeguard liberties. \u2022 Cameron has said that he hopes that future changes to internet surveillance laws will be agreed by consensus. I think this Ripa review that David Anderson and the cross-party can look at may help to build some more consensus. I think it is important to try and proceed on the basis of consensus. I don't want this very difficult and sensitive area to be subject to a whole lot of party-political ding-dong. I don't think that would be good for our country. I don't think that would be good for our security. (Fat chance, some might say.) \u2022 Clegg has insisted that today's bill does not amount to a revival of the \"snoopers' charter\". This is what he told the press conference. Crucially, this bill has nothing to do with the so-called \u2018snoopers' charter\u2019. That was a Home Office proposal to store every website you\u2019ve ever visited for a whole year. I blocked that last year, and I\u2019ve blocked every further attempt to bring it back \u2022 Ministers have announced MPs will get just one day to debate all stages of the data retention bill. It will go through the Commons on Tuesday. The Lords will debate it on Wednesday and Thursday, and any Lords amendments will be considered by MPs on Thursday evening. The government says the bill must be on the statute book before the summer recess, which starts the following week. \u2022 Some MPs have strongly criticised the government for rushing the bill through parliament. In the Commons Labour's Tom Watson said the rushed timetable was a mistake. Addressing May, he said: I have no doubt the home secretary will get her Bill through, but the price will be a perception that it is as a result of a last-minute deal between elites with little scrutiny by parliament or civic society and that the rushed legislation might unravel ... British people aren't stupid and they aren't ideological when it comes to this kind of thing. Why can they not have time to discuss it with their elected representatives? But the Conservative MP Philip Hollobone said the Lib Dems were to blame for the fact that the bill was only being published now. And, in the Lords, Lord West, security minister in the last Labour government, said the Lib Dems should be \"ashamed\" that they did not support May's original communications data bill (aka, the \"snoopers' charter). If they had, there would be no need for this bill, he said. \u2022 Cameron has said the bill is needed to avert two \"cliff edge\" crises that could damage national security within the next few weeks. First, without a new law on data retention, phone companies might start destroying records currently used by the police in 95% of serious crime investigations. Unless we act now companies will no longer retain the data about who contacted who, where and when, and we will no longer be able to use this information to bring criminals to justice and keep our country safe. And, second, he said without legislation on investigation powers, phone and internet companies might start very soon refusing to respond to demands for intercept data. Some companies are already saying they can no longer work with us unless UK law is clarified immediately. Sometimes in the dangerous world in which we live we need our security services to listen to someone's phone and read their emails to identify and disrupt a terrorist plot. As prime minister I know of examples where doing this has stopped a terrorist attack. \u2022 Cameron has said that the transparency safeguards being introduced alongside the bill will reduce the number of organisations that can access communications information using the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act. \"Organisations like the Royal Mail, the Charity Commission, the pensions regulator among more than a dozen bodies that will lose access to this data,\" he said. Clegg said that in future councils wanting to access data via Ripa would no longer be able to aproach phone companies directly. Instead, they would have to go through a central body, he said. \u2022 Civil liberty campaigners have accused the government of trying to circumvent a European court of justice ruling that declared current data retention practices illegal. (See 9.41am and 12.39pm.) \u2022 Clegg has said that he favours having an opposition politician always chair the intelligence and security committee. This is Labour's position too. Clegg and Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, say this would bolster public confidence in the ISC. Cameron rejected this proposal, although he said recent changes meant the ISC's chair was now elected by its members, which meant an opposition MP could become chair.\nAnd this is from Jimmy Wales, the Wikipedia founder. It is difficult to comment on legislation based on a press release. If the government expects the public and civil society to accept this, they need to do more than offer platitudes. They have known of this problem for weeks, and there is no reason to rush through legislation without appropriate public and Parliamentary scrutiny. I hope there is a significant chance that the Lords will reject this timetable to enable sufficient time for a proper debate to take place.\nShami Chakrabarti, director of campaign group Liberty, has criticised the emergency data retention bill. The government says it's only plugging loopholes but its existing blanket surveillance practice has been found unlawful. We are told this is a paedophile and jihadi 'emergency', but the court judgment they seek to ignore was handed down over three months ago and this isn't snooping on suspects but on everyone. We are promised greater scrutiny and debate but not until 2016, as it seems that all three party leaders have done a deal in private. No privacy for us and no scrutiny for them. Will Clegg and Cameron's 'debate for the future' really comfort voters and companies today?\nBob Stewart, a Conservative, asks May to confirm that lives could be lost if the bill does not become law. May agrees. Innocent lives could be lost, she says. The statement is now over. I will post a summary, including the highlights from the Cameron/Clegg press conference and from May's statement, shortly.\nHere is the full text of the draft data retention and investigatory powers bill (pdf). It runs to 7 pages.\nAnd here are the explanatory notes (pdf).\nPhilip Hollobone, a Conservative, says the three-month delay was down to the Lib Dems humming and hawing. May says the coalition has been ensuring that it responds to the EU directive in a way that is appropriate.\nMay says the European commission will look at the need for a new data retention directive. But that will take some time, she says.\nRobert Halfon, a Conservative, asks May to consider a British internet bill of rights. May says that is an interesting suggestion. This whole question, of the internet and privacy, is one that the review will look at, she says.\nRobert Buckland, a Conservative, asks if the recommendations on proportionality in the ECJ ruling will be observed in the bill. May says they will be. The data retention clauses will apply only to a specific list of particular types of data. And there will be an absolute 12-month time limit for data retention.\nMay says lives could be lost if this legislation does not get through.\nSir Menzies Campbell, the former Lib Dem leader, says Roy Jenkins brought emergency legislation dealing with Northern Ireland through the Commons on the same timetable.\nLabour's Tom Watson says that May will get her bill through, but at the price of it appearing to be a rushed deal between elites. We have a tradition of policing through consent. Does May think the same should apply to the security services? May says some MPs think that when the frontbenches agree, that amounts to a conspiracy that should be arrested. But in fact it is a sign of the seriousness of these issues, she says.\nLabour's David Winnick says there is \"much misgiving\" about the bill being rushed through next week. He won't be supporting it, he says.\nPete Wishart, the SNP MP, says the Home Office has not discussed this with the Scottish government, even though it is in charge of policing in Scotland. This is snoopers' charter, the prequel, he says. May says she will discuss this with the Scottish government. This is about tackling serious crime and terrorism, she says. She is\nMark Field, a Conservative, says he is uncomfortable about emergency legislation. And he is also wary when there is a cross-party consensus. But, in this case, he thinks the bill is necessary. May says this is not about new powers.\nLabour's Chris Bryant says he sympathises with David Davis. Wouldn't it be better to have the bill debated in the Commons over two days, not one day? May says she understands the point. The draft bill is being published today. She wants the Commons to deal with it in timely way, she says.\nMay says she does not see the choice between liberty and security as a binary one. You can only have liberty with security, she says.\nMay says the review that she is setting up is intended to produce a report before the general election, so it can influence legislation after the election.\nThe DUP's Ian Paisley says all law-abiding citizens in Northern Ireland will support legislation that defends the realm.\nDavid Davis, the Conservative backbencher, says the case was put to the ECJ long before the ruling in April. The government had plenty of time to think about this. So why is this an emergency? May says it was never going to be possible to take this bill through parliament in the normal way. Until the ECJ had ruled, no one knew what it was going to say, she says.\nKeith Vaz, the Labour chair of the home affairs committee, says he supports the bill. May will be giving evidence to the committee next week. That will be part of the scrutiny process, he says.\nSir Alan Beith, the Lib Dem chair of the justice committee, suggests some authority beyond ministers might be needed to justify the highest intrusion of privacy. May says the joint committee looking at the draft bill said the arrangements in place yesterday were appropriate.\nHazel Blears, the Labour former Home Office minister, says she welcomes the proposals on data retention. But she is concerned about the plans to extend the territoriality of intercept powers. May says the government has asserted that extra-territorial powers exist in Ripa. But the new legislation with make it absolutely clear that warrants can apply outside the UK to add extra certainty.\nRichard Ottaway, the Conservative chair of the foreign affairs committee, says he thinks the bill is \"absolutely essential\".\nAlan Johnson, the Labour former home secetary, says restoring the status quo is vital, but not sufficient. Haven't we wasted five years that could have been spent addressing the gaps in the legislation? Doesn't that mean the security services are lacking powers they need? May says this is an issue that needs to be addressed. She still supports the draft communications data bill, she says. (This was the one Nick Clegg blocked.)\nGood point from my colleague Patrick Wintour.\nMay is responding to Cooper. As for the timing, May says the government has spent \"quite a time\" thinking about how best to respond to the ECJ ruling. But it was always going to be necessary for this to be fast-track legislation. She says six select committee chairman were briefed on the bill yesterday. A draft version of the bill is being published today. The full one will come on Monday. The bill narrows the scope of the legislation, she says. It clarifies that economic well-being can only be used as a justification for surveillance in the context of national security. As for the review, it will not just cover the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act. It will be more wide-ranging, she says. Any regulatory changes made after the election should stand the test of \"a reasonable amount of time\", she says. May says David Anderson will undertake the review. She is glad, given his expertise. She has not discussed his terms of reference yet. And she will ensure he has the support he needs.\nYvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, is responding to May now. (She has already set out her views on a letter to Labour MPs. See 11.06am.) But there will be concern about the lack of time set aside for debate. That is why the safeguards are essential, she says. She says the late arrival of the bill risks undermining public confidence in it. It is right that parliament will revisit this next year, she says. She says Labour called for a review of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa) earlier this year. She welcomes the fact that the government has agreed. She says she wants David Anderson, the government's independent reviewer of terror legislation, to carry that out. Does May agree? Does May agree that an opposition figure should chair the intelligence and security committee?\nMay says the government would be negligent if it did not give the police the powers they need. They are clear that the government needs to act urgently, she says.\nMay says the timetable for the bill will be \"tight\". But the government has to have royal assent by the summer recess. So it will be as short as possible, she says. More wide-ranging legislation will be considered after the election, she says. Alongside the bill being published today, other safeguards will be introduced. (See 8.41am.)\nThe Labour MP Chris Bryant has tweeted this about what he points out is the DRIP (data retention and investigation powers) bill.\nDavid Cameron is in the chamber for the statement, sitting alongside Theresa May.\nMay says the government is proposing a \"narrow\" bill. She is not bringing back the communications data bill that was published in draft. That was blocked by the Lib Dems, she says, and this matter will have to be resolved at the election.\nTheresa May, the home secretary, is making a statement to MPs about the emergency surveillance bill now. Some of what she says will duplicate what David Cameron and Nick Clegg said earlier. I'll will just focus on the new material. The most interesting feature of the statement will probably be what backbench MPs have to say. So far only Tom Watson, I think, has spoken out against the bill.\nEd Miliband and Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, have written a joint letter to Labour MPs explaining why they are supporting the emergency bill. Here is the text in full. Dear colleague, As a result of a recent judgement by the European Court of Justice, the police and intelligence agencies are in danger of losing vital information which is used in 95% of serious and organised crime investigations as well as counter terror investigations and online child abuse. In order to prevent this, UK legislation needs to change to be compliant with EU law. If these changes are not made, the police are likely to suddenly lose vital evidence this summer. The Government has come forward with emergency legislation and in considering our response, we have been guided by our firm conviction that it is essential to maintain the security of our citizens and also ensure people\u2019s privacy is protected. Serious criminal investigations and counter terrorism intelligence operations must not be jeopardised. That is why we are supporting this emergency legislation which we accept is designed solely to protect existing capabilities. However, given the limited Parliamentary time to discuss emergency legislation we have ensured that the Government agree to make this legislation temporary \u2013 it will expire in 2016. That will require the Government and Parliament properly to consult on and consider longer term proposals next year. We have also now secured agreement to our proposal for a major independent review of the legal framework governing data access and interception (the RIPA review we called for earlier this year) in the light of the huge changes in technology. As we have previously argued, in the wake of the Snowden leaks and the concerns raised about whether the legal framework has failed to keep up with new technology, we need a wider public debate about the right balance between security and privacy online, a review of powers and stronger oversight. This review will enable longer term questions and concerns to be properly dealt with and debated in time for new legislation. Changes will then follow. We have also called for and secured further safeguards to restrict the ways in which communications data and intercept can be used to prevent misuse. We have raised serious concerns with the Government about this rushed process and we will scrutinise the detail in Parliament next week. But we will support the temporary legislation with the safeguards we have secured as it would be far too damaging to the fight against serious crime, online child abuse and counter terrorist intelligence to suddenly lose these capabilities now, and our safeguards have secured a better process for longer term reform to make sure we have the right capabilities and the right safeguards in place.\nQ: How close was the UK to the cliff edge? Cameron says there were two cliff edges. On comms data, that would not have disappeared instantly. But companies would have had to start destroying data, unless they were keeping it for a specific use. There would have been a \"declining capability\". The police and security services were saying that was very worrying. With intercept information, there was more a cliff edge there, he says. Phone companies were saying they were going to stop sharing the information, he says. That's it. The press conference is over.\nQ: When did you decide on emergency legislation? And your description of the process is very different to what Edward Snowden said was happening. Cameron says there are two problems: comms data, and legal intercept. On comms data, the government decided the best way to deal with the problem was through legislation. And, on the legal intercept problem, it came to the same conclusion. He says the government has been discussing the need for legislation over the past few weeks. Clegg says the EU directive on data retention did not contain the necessary checks and balances. On Snowden, Cameron says he looked at this very carefully post-Snowden. He came to the conclusion that a very sound set of arrangements are in place. If the security services want to listen to a conversation, they need a warrant. He says the account of how this operates in the report (pdf) from the intercept commissioner, Sir Anthony May, is very good. He says journalists should read it.\nQ: Do you admit you are taking a risk by not going further now? And, if a threat materialises, will you have blood on your hands? Cameron says it would not be right to use emergency legislation to give the government extra powers. But there is a debate to be had in the future about retaining metadata, and how you allow communications to be intercepted. The review of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa) might point to the way forward. But, Cameron says, he does not want this to be subject to a party-political ding-dong. That would not be good for the country. Clegg says ISP addresses are not traceable to individuals. That needs to be addressed. But he does not think that every single power requested by the security services should be granted. That is why he rejected the idea that every website visited by someone should be stored for a whole year. That did not seem proportionate, he says.\nQ: The Snowden revelations suggested the security services could do all this anyway? And would you agree to Labour's call for an opposition MP to chair the intelligence and security committee. Cameron says the Commons has just legislated to change the way the ISC chooses its chair. Now the ISC's members will elected the chair. An opposition figure could be chosen. Clegg says he thinks it would be a good idea for the chair of the ISC to come from the ranks of the opposition. But that is something for the future, he says.\nQ: Did you not set your face against a review of the security services after the Snowden revelations? And why are you doing this under emergency powers? Cameron says this is an emergency. If the government does not deal with the data retention issue, phone companies might start deleting their records soon. And companies have said they might start not cooperating with requests for access to lawful intercepts, he says. On the EU legislation, Cameron says the UK did not have primary legislation in this area. It only had secondary legislation under the EU directive. Countries like Denmark have their own primary legislation. So they don't need to act. On warrants, Cameron says the British system is a strong one. No one's phone can be listened to unless a warrant has been signed by the home secretary. And the intercept commissioner reviews this. The intelligence and security committee reviews this too. This is one of the best systems in the world. As for a debate on this issue, Cameron says he is all for a debate. But he wants to ensure that the government has the powers it needs while that debate takes place. He says, when the phone replaced the letter, it would have been a mistake for the government to not change its intercept law.\nCameron and Clegg are now taking questions. Q: How is this different from state-sponsored phone and email hacking? And shouldn't we be very suspicious of politicians passing emergency legislation? Cameron says the government has the power to do two things. First, finding who called who when. In 95% of serious crimes, that has been vital. The government is not extending that. It is just allowing it to continue, and ensuring the phone companies do not destroy that data. As for whether the public should worry, he says the public should worry if the government does not act. The time to debate what more can be done will be in the future. Cameron asks whether the government should allow a means of communications that paedophiles, terrorists and criminals can used without being accessed. His view is that that should not be allowed. In extremis, the government should be able to intercept those communications. But that is a debate for another day, he says. Clegg says the public should be sceptical. As an old-fashioned liberal, he thinks people should ask questions. This is only maintaining existing arrangements, he says. And he says there is a \"poison pill\" in the bill that will ensure it lapses in 2016. That amounts to a guarantee that the government is acting proportionately, he says.\nNick Clegg is speaking now. As a Liberal Democrat, he thinks successive governments have not done enough to protect liberties. But he says he will not allow a threat to the public to exist. Liberty and security must go hand in hand. He says he has been persuaded that the government needs to act, and to act fast. He says this bill has nothing to do with the so-called snoopers' charter. That was a proposal to allow companies to store every website you visit for a whole year. He blocked that, he says. This bill only restores the existing law, he says. And he says he is only supporting it because it will mark the start of a wider conversation about civil liberties. The legislation only lasts until 2016. So the next government will be forced to look again at these big issues, he says. He says in March he asked the Royal United Services Institute to consider reforms to internet law. That work is on-going. And the government will be appointing a diplomat to negotiate an agreement on sharing data with the US. And he says the number of public bodies that can easily access communications data will be cut \"radically\". Councils will not be able to approach phone companies directly. They will have to go through a central body, and then a magistrate. This is a \"balance package\", he says.\nCameron says he is not prepared to be a prime minister who addressed people after a terrorist incident, saying he could have done more to prevent it. He will always ensure the security services get the tools they need, he says.\nCameron is now talking about the safeguards that will be introduced. (See 8.41am.) First, the number of organisations that can access communications data will be restricted. For example, the Royal Mail, the Charities Commission and the Pensions Regulator will no longer get access to information, he says. Second, a privacy and civil liberties oversight board will be set up. (The Times columnist David Aaronovitch thinks Alan Rusbridger, the Guardian's editor-in-chief, should be on it.)\nCameron says the bill will restore existing capabilities. But new safeguards are being introduced too. And he says he wants this to be the start of a conversation, going into the next parliament, about how legislation in this area can be overhauled.\nCameron is now talking about what the new legislation will do. He says parliament will consider the bill before the summer recess. There will be a full debate next week.\nCameron is summarising what Downing Street said in the press release about why legislation was needed. (See 8.41am.) He mentions the European court of justice ruling. He says this did no cover the contents of communications; he is just talking about the metadata, showing who was talking to who, and when. And he says that, in relation to allowing the security sevices to access the content of communications, the laws are much tighter. Sometimes the security services need to be allowed to read emails to be able to disrupt a terrorist plot. The government needs the cooperation of companies, he says. But some companies are now challenging this, because the legal position is uncertain. Some firms are saying they cannot work with the authorities unless UK law is clarified. Cameron says he will not stand by and allow this cooperation to end.\nDavid Cameron and Nick Clegg are starting their press conference on the emergency data retention bill. You can read what Downing Street is saying about the bill at 8.41am.\nThe Lib Dem MP Julian Huppert has sent an email to party members defending the emergency bill. Here's an extract. The European Court of Justice threw out the European Data Retention Directive, which underpins all collection of communications data in this country. I sympathise with the reasons, but we must acknowledge that it causes real problems \u2013 we do need to have some way to keep some communications data, but under very careful control. Some people would love to use this to bring back the awful Communications Data Bill \u2013 known as the Snooper\u2019s Charter \u2013 that Nick vetoed last year. A number of Tories pushed it and Labour tried something similar themselves. We will not allow this to happen. We\u2019ve blocked it once, and we will continue to do so. This legislation just allows the agencies to continue with their current abilities ... We need to completely rewrite the law in this area. But that cannot be done quickly. We have to get it right, which will take a lot of work from many experts. We\u2019ve already started that off \u2013 our \u2018Digital Bill of Rights\u2019 motion calls for a commission of experts to review all state surveillance and information from the Snowden revelations \u2013 that takes time. Nick has already started this work with the Royal United Services Institute, and they need to finish that work. So I think it is right to agree to a stop-gap. A piece of legislation that can be passed quickly, but crucially will automatically expire at the end of 2016, giving time to write something better, and the certainty of knowing it will not just become entrenched. And in this stop-gap legislation, we should agree to no more than was previously allowed. And we\u2019ve managed better than that \u2013 we\u2019ve also negotiated and won a package of pro-civil liberties measures to go with it.\nAnd the Lib Dem blogger Stephen Tall has posted this in response.\nLabour's Ben Bradshaw also thinks the government could have published this legislation sooner.\nThe Press Association had a reporter outside Downing Street as ministers were leaving after this morning's special cabinet meeting to discuss the emergency bill. Ministers did not comment as they left 10 Downing Street after an hour-long emergency meeting of cabinet. Liberal Democrat energy secretary Ed Davey shook his head when reporters asked if the new legislation amounted to a \"snoopers' charter\". As he left No 10, work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith was asked whether the legislation was a snoopers' charter. He replied: \"I don't know what you mean.\"\nBig Brother Watch has also condemned the emergency bill. This is from Emma Carr, its acting director. It is a basic principle of a free society that you don't monitor people who are not under suspicion. Considering the snoopers' charter has already been rejected by the public as well as by the highest court in Europe, it is essential that the government does not rush head-first into creating new legislation. The EU's data retention laws privatised snooping, meaning companies were paid by governments to record what citizens were doing and retain that information for a year. We need to get back to a point where the police monitor people who are actually suspected of wrongdoing, rather than wasting millions every year requiring data to be stored on an indiscriminate basis.\nHere's David Allen Green, the law and legal blogger (aka Jack of Kent) on the emergency bill.\nThe Sun's Tom Newton Dunn thinks civil libertarians (see 9.41am) should not be so worried.\nThe Open Rights Group, which campaigns for digital rights, has condemned the emergency surveillance bill. It says the government is defying the European court of justice. This is from the group's executive director, Jim Killock. The government knows that since the CJEU [court of justice of the EU] ruling, there is no legal basis for making internet service providers retain our data so it is using the threat of terrorism as an excuse for getting this law passed. The government has had since April to address the CJEU ruling but it is only now that organisations such as ORG are threatening legal action that this has become an \u2018emergency'. Not only will the proposed legislation infringe our right to privacy, it will also set a dangerous precedent where the government simply re-legislates every time it disagrees with a decision by the CJEU. The ruling still stands and these new plans may actually increase the amount of our personal data that is retained by ISPs, further infringing on our right to privacy. Blanket surveillance needs to end. That is what the court has said. The group set out its thinking in more detail in this briefing note for MPs yesterday. And here is a link to the European court of justice ruling from April (pdf).\nAfter the press conference at 10.15am, there will be a statement from Theresa May in the Commons on the emergency surveillance bill, starting at about 11.15am.\nTom Watson, the Labour MP who described the prospect of emergency legislation on surveillance as \"something terrible\" on Twitter last night (see 8.27am), told the Today programme it was wrong to rush a bill of this kind through parliament. He was not just attacking David Cameron and Nick Clegg; he made it clear that he was also unhappy with the Labour leadership for supporting the bill. This is a secret deal between party leaders. There hasn\u2019t been a bill published and yet we find out this morning, when Parliament is on one-line whip and MPs are in their constituencies, that next week they will railroad emergency legislation to put right a decision made by the European court of justice that the current legislation was beyond human rights law. Now that doesn\u2019t seem right to me. There are hundreds of thousands of people out there very concerned about this particular policy issue. They\u2019ve not seen this bill either, but it doesn\u2019t really matter this year because there\u2019s been a deal done between the three parties and it\u2019ll be railroaded through. If you\u2019re an MP you probably shouldn\u2019t bother turning up to work next week because what you thinking doesn\u2019t really matter. Watson said that he would certainly vote against the bill's programme motion (the one limiting the amount of time set aside for the debate on the bill) and that he might vote against other aspects too. MPs needed time to form a view on legislation, he said, and it was wrong for the government to be rushing this through when it knew about the European court of justice ruling six weeks ago. Watson said Rifkind's interview (see 9.10am) showed that the government was \"ramping up the rhetoric\". \"It's a stitch-up,\" he said. \"It's a secret deal between the three parties.\" He said out his views in more detail last night on his blog.\nDavid Cameron and Nick Clegg will be explaining the emergency data retention bill at a press conference at 10.15am.\nSir Malcolm Rifkind, the chair of the intelligence and security and a former Conservative foreign secretary, told the Today programme a few minutes ago that he thought people would probably be able to feel \"very comfortable\" with the emergency bill. He said that he had been briefed on the plans two days ago. He stressed that his committee didn't \"automatically support what the government is doing\" and he said his committee would want to look at the terms of the bill. But he said he accepted the case for legislation. Broadly speaking, what the government is doing, it is not changing the status quo. It is continuing the arrangements that have existed for the last few years and which are of enormous importance to the police and others in preventing serious crime and catching people who have committed serious crimes. He said the recent European court of justice ruling said the existing current EU directive governing data retention did not contain enough safeguards. Negotiating a new EU directive with appropriate safeguards would take months, he said. In the meantime, the government needed to legislate. He went on: If that is what they are doing, then it's actually something we can all be very comfortable with ... The fact that it already has the support of the Labour party and the Liberal Democrats - that's pretty unusual for all three parties to come together and say, yes we recognise this is not extending the law, it's confirming it. And if that is the case, and we're satisfied that's what the bill does, then I think the public can be reassured.\nIt looks as if Julian Huppert, one of the leading civil libertarians in the Liberal Democrats, will be defending the emergency bill.\nAnd this is what Nick Clegg is saying about the emergency data retention bill. (See 8.41am.) We know the consequences of not acting are serious, but this urgency will not be used as an excuse for more powers, or for a \u2018snoopers' charter\u2019. I believe that successive governments have neglected civil liberties in the pursuit of greater security. We will be the first government in many decades to increase transparency and oversight, and make significant progress in defence of liberty. But liberty and security must go hand in hand. We can\u2019t enjoy our freedom if we\u2019re unable to keep ourselves safe. I've taken the quote from the Number 10 press release.\nDavid Cameron will be speaking about his plans today.\nDowning Street has sent out a lengthy press release with details of the emergency surveillance legislation (or \"emergency security legislation\", as Number 10 calls it) being announced today. Formally, its the data retention and investigation powers bill. Here's what it says. I have inserted some headlines to make it easier to read. The headlines are mine, but the text comes from the Number 10 news release. The only things I have left out are a quote from David Cameron (which I've already posted - see 8.27am) and a quote from Nick Clegg, which I will post later. Why the law is needed Emergency legislation to ensure that UK law enforcement and intelligence agencies can maintain their ability to access the telecommunications data they need to investigate criminal activity and protect the public will be announced today by the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister. This has cross party agreement. The Government is taking this action following two recent developments. First, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has struck down regulations enabling Communications Service Providers (CSPs) to retain communications data for law enforcement purposes for up to 12 months. Unless they have a business reason to hold this data, internet and phone companies will start deleting it which has serious consequences for investigations \u2013 investigations which can take many months and which rely on retrospectively accessing data for evidential purposes. Secondly, some companies are calling for a clearer legal framework to underpin their cooperation with law enforcement and intelligence agencies to intercept what terrorists and serious criminals are saying to each other. This is the ability to access content with a warrant signed by a Secretary of State. Both of these issues have left the UK Government with an urgent need to bring forward emergency legislation. What is happening The emergency Data Retention and Investigation Powers Billwill enable agencies to maintain existing capabilities. It will respond to the ECJ judgment on data retention and bring clarity to existing law in response to CSPs\u2019 requests. Without action, our law enforcement and intelligence agencies will lose sight of data that is crucial for protecting national security and preventing serious crime, and lose track of some dangerous individuals as a result. At the same time, the PM and DPM will also announce new measures to increase transparency and oversight. In addition there will also be a sunset clause after two years. What the extra transparency and oversight measures are The following steps will also be taken to strengthen oversight and transparency: The Bill includes a termination clause that ensures the legislation falls at the end of 2016 and the next government is forced to look again at these powers. Between now and 2016 we will hold a full view of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, to make recommendations for how it could be reformed and updated. We will appoint a senior diplomat to lead discussions with the American government and the internet companies to establish a new international agreement for sharing data between legal jurisdictions. We will establish a Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board on the American model, to ensure that civil liberties are properly considered in the formulation of government policy on counter-terrorism. This will be based on David Anderson's existing role as the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation. We will restrict the number of public bodies that are able to approach phone and internet companies and ask for communications data. Some bodies will lose their powers to access data altogether while local authorities will be required to go through a single central authority who will make the request on their behalf. Finally, we will publish annual transparency reports, making more information publicly available than ever before on the way that surveillance powers operate. What communications data is Communications Data (metadata about communications \u2013 not the content of communications) has been used in 95% of all serious organised crime cases handled by the Crown Prosecution Service. It has been used in every major Security Service counter-terrorism investigation over the last decade. It is particularly important for targeting serious criminals, including drug dealers, paedophiles and fraudsters. It has also been used to stop crimes in action and save lives, and to prevent miscarriages of justice. The ability to access communications dataretrospectivelyis crucial in developing intelligence and evidence about the activities of suspects, victims and vulnerable people for the period before a crime or other incident has taken place. A large number of criminal investigations rely on communications data that is several months old at the point it is acquired by law enforcement. For example, an ACPO survey has shown that just over half of the CD acquired during child abuse investigations is between six months and 12 months old. But this capability is under threat. The European Courts recently struck down their legal underpinning for companies to hold on to information for 12 months, which is vital for our security and intelligence agencies to conduct their investigations. Why keeping communications data is valuable to the police and emergency services Without a clear legal basis in UK law, and unless they retain it for business need, companies will soon stop providing this data on the regulated, authorisation basis that they have done for many years and may even start deleting data which is essential for law enforcement and national security. The government therefore plans to introduce a simple piece of fast track legislation to restore the legal basis for companies to hold this data - it will take due account of the recommendations the ECJ made in its judgment. Were these powers lost, it would be harder or impossible to effectively investigate a range of crimes, including: Murder\u2013 those who conspired to assist the killers of Rhys Jones were caught using evidence from mobile phones, which proved they were associating at certain key times and places. Sexual exploitation\u2013 the men who groomed young girls in Rochdale were prosecuted, in part, using mobile phone call evidence which showed their association with each other and contact with victims. Drugs\u2013 a gang operating in Merseyside, Lancashire, Glasgow and South Wales in 2011 was found with 30kg of drugs and \u00a337,000. Mobile phone call and text evidence was used to determine the gang\u2019s hierarchy and identify key individuals. This resulted in the arrest of two gang members not otherwise identified using normal surveillance techniques. Door step fraud\u2013 a gang who conned an 85-year-old were prosecuted using evidence that they had called the victims repeatedly from their mobile phone. Locating Vulnerable People\u2013 Mobile phone location data was used to direct a search by Mountain Rescue and locate an elderly man with medical conditions, who had gone missing following a hospital appointment. Although it is difficult to be definitive about the impact of not requiring companies to retain this data, a major recent Europol investigation into online child sexual exploitation (known as Operation Rescue) gives an indication of what the impact would be: Of 371 suspects identified in the UK, 240 cases were investigated and 121 arrests or convictions were possible. One man was sentenced in March 2010 to six years\u2019 imprisonment for sexual abuse of two minors after police discovered more than 60,000 indecent images on his computer.In contrast, of 377 suspects identified in Germany, which has no such data retention arrangements, only seven could be investigated and no arrests were made. What a lawful intercept is The interception of communications be it listening to the calls made on a telephone, or opening and reading the contents of a subject of interest's letters or emails, are an important capability for both the police and Intelligence agencies. Authorised by the Secretary of State, it is used, alongside other covert capabilities and techniques, to develop an understanding of the threat posed by individuals and networks, to build our coverage of their activities, and to identify means by which to disrupt them before they damage the UK or endanger lives. Since 2010, all of MI5\u2019s top priority UK counter-terrorism investigations have used interception in some form to identify, understand or disrupt plots seeking to harm the UK and its citizens. The value that visibility of online communications can bring to understanding terrorist threats is clear. Just last month it was revealed in court that Mashudur Choudhury, now the first person in the UK to be convicted of terrorist offences in connection with the Syria conflict, had received advice on how to access extremist training and weaponry in Syria through online calls with other extremists based overseas. This is not an isolated incident - access to communications by and between criminals or terrorists is critical to the ongoing security of the UK and its citizens. The loss or reduction of this capability will seriously harm our ability to investigate and disrupt such threats in the future.\nLast night the Labour MP Tom Watson posted a dramatic message on Twitter.\nHe was referring to emergency legislation on surveillance that David Cameron is announcing today. Patrick Wintour and Alan Travis wrote a story last night previewing what is coming up and, within the last 30 minutes, Downing Street has confirmed that the legislation is being announced this morning. The cabinet is meeting now to discuss the proposals. The BBC's Nick Robinson has some of the details. The legislation has cross-party support and supposedly it does not give the state new powers. Instead it just cancels out the impact of a recent European court of justice ruling that removed the obligation on phone and internet companies to keep data. But this is a hugely controversial issue, and Watson is unlikely to be the only MP concerned about how quickly it is being rushed through parliament. Downing Street has just released this statement about the legislation from David Cameron. It is the first duty of government to protect our national security and to act quickly when that security is compromised. As events in Iraq and Syria demonstrate, now is not the time to be scaling back on our ability to keep our people safe. The ability to access information about communications and intercept the communications of dangerous individuals is essential to fight the threat from criminals and terrorists targeting the UK. No government introduces fast track legislation lightly. But the consequences of not acting are grave. I want to be very clear that we are not introducing new powers or capabilities \u2013 that is not for this Parliament. This is about restoring two vital measures ensuring that our law enforcement and intelligence agencies maintain the right tools to keep us all safe. I will be focusing on this announcement, and the reaction to it, during the day. MPs are likely to discuss the issue when they debate the UK's justice and home affairs opt-outs in a debate starting at around 11.30am. There is unlikely to be a vote, but the debate will allow Conservative Eurosceptics to express their concerns about issues like the European arrest warrant. My colleague Mark Tran will be covering today's public sector strikes on a separate blog. If you want to follow me on Twitter, I'm on @AndrewSparrow.\n", "title": "Cameron announcing emergency surveillance legislation: Politics live blog"}, {"date": "2015-06-02T08:11:04Z", "body": "Well chaps, for some odd reason the day has passed in largely orderly fashion. I feel safe leaving you all to your evenings. Let\u2019s wrap for tonight and regroup at first frost. Today, Tuesday, in Canberra Two polls showed Labor would win an election held today \u2013 but the longer view suggests the prime minister is turning around some of the negative community sentiment about him. The prime minister told colleagues they could stop leaking or face the consequences. (I suspect the prime minister would face some consequences if he made colleagues face consequences because that\u2019s how these chain reactions tend to go. Lance one boil, and another appears.) But chill out and come to Jesus, as a wise public man once said of his predicament. It was a busy day on the rhetoric. Tony Abbott told voters, via the live broadcast opportunity of question time, that Bill Shorten hated Sydney and wanted to depress the value of your house. This free character reference followed a question from Shorten about whether Abbott agreed with the recent assessment from the government\u2019s top economic adviser that there was a housing bubble (not in a good way) in Sydney. Join the dots people. That King of Zing is coming for your house. It remains unclear whether the treasury secretary, John Fraser, is coming for it too. Or possibly the RBA, given today it pledged to work with other regulators to assess and contain risks that may arise from the housing market. Watch that Glenn Stephens, I implore you. The prime minister also told people via their question time wireless that when it came to the question of citizenship, anyone who raises a gun or a knife to Australians simply because of who we are and the values we have, has forfeited his or right to consider himself one of us. At the moment, you can have your citizenship revoked for fighting for a foreign power. Just for the record, there is still no detailed policy on the government\u2019s next proposed iteration of citizenship revocations. More of raising various items visually shortly. Meanwhile, the serious issue of whether things might be getting a teensy bit out of control in the South China Sea bubbled away. A leak to The Australian suggested the Abbott government was thinking about getting the RAAF to fly past China\u2019s now weaponised artifical islands. Two statements from the defence minister\u2019s office failed to rule that course of action out comprehensively. Both statements suggested this fly by activity through international zones happened in the normal course of events. One statement said there had been no \u201cformal\u201d talks to escalate Australia\u2019s activity in the region at the defence secretary level. Labor\u2019s foreign affairs spokeswoman Tanya Plibersek clearly thought this was a less desirable course of action than Labor\u2019s defence spokesman Stephen Conroy. Now, to that issue of taking up cudgels. Visuals. #BrickTones has some guidelines. Can one take up a cutlass? No. Absolutely not.\nBear this in mind as you go about your business in orderly fashion. Bless Mike Bowers for his #Bricks, because God knows, we can all use a laugh. Bless the readers for their #BrickBats. See you on the morrows.\nReaders who have hung in with me since lunchtime (you treasures) will remember that at the end of question time there was contention about whether the Liberal MP Brett Whiteley, took an authorised photograph in the chamber. Whitely said he did not, and made a crack about the manager of opposition business, Tony Burke, not knowing a flash if he saw one. Burke isn\u2019t evidently inclined to let it go. The Burke office has spliced together some footage to let you decide whether this was a selfie or not. Have a look.\nMy ruling? Either Whiteley is shading his eyes from sudden dazzling sunlight (possible), or he\u2019s holding up a smart phone at a distinctly selfie-looking angle. Madam Speaker is investigating.\nA bit more on the attributes of the two leaders, Tony Abbott and Bill Shorten, which Essential ascertains via a bunch of questions. Tony Abbott\u2019s key attributes were out of touch with ordinary people (65%), narrow-minded (63%), arrogant (62%) and hard working (59%). Since February, the largest shifts have been for out of touch with ordinary people (-7), erratic (-6) and a capable leader (+6). Overall, Tony Abbott\u2019s ratings have recovered from the lows of February to be at similar levels to December last year. Bill Shorten\u2019s key attributes were intelligent (61%), hard working (60%), understands the problems facing Australia (49%), superficial (44%) and a capable leader (43%). Overall, there has been little change in Bill Shorten\u2019s ratings since February. Compared to Bill Shorten, Tony Abbott is much more likely to be considered narrow-minded (+29), intolerant (+24), out of touch with ordinary people (+23) and arrogant (+23). Bill Shorten is regarded by more respondents to be someone who understands the problems facing Australia (-11) and intelligent (-10). The gap on \u201ca capable leader has reduced from 13 points to 3 points \u2013 Tony Abbott is up 6% and Bill Shorten down 4%. So what can we take from that? If we look at the major published polling data from the first six months of this year we can see a modest improvement for Tony Abbott since his real low point, which was the Prince Phillip knighthood and the leadership spill motion. Shorten has been out in front in the sentiment stakes. Abbott is beginning to close the gap, gradually. Oh and Essential\u2019s two party preferred number? Labor 52, Coalition 48. Same as Newspoll.\nLet\u2019s take a look at the Essential poll now, which is mildly interesting. Marriage equality first. Essential\u2019s positive number is lower than Crosby Textor\u2019s positive number from July 2014, but it\u2019s still a clear majority. 59% of the sample agreed that people of the same sex should be allowed to marry and 30% think they should not. This is apparently the same result as a survey taken in February. Breaking down the metrics. Support for same sex marriage is 54% among men and 64% among women. 69% of under 35\u2019s support same sex marriage \u2013 while those aged 65+ are split 43% in favour/43% against.\nOn Sky News now, Liberal Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, who is coordinating a consultation process on the citizenship proposal, was asked several times \u2013 five or six \u2013 whether the government might withdraw from an international treaty which prevents Australian rendering people stateless. She did not rule that out. Which could mean something, or nothing. These days, with all things liable to change without notice, it\u2019s hard to tell.\nTerrific story from my colleague Lenore Taylor, about the TPP, which is about to land with a thud. Australian politicians have been told they can view the current confidential negotiating text for the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, but only if they agree not to divulge anything they see for four years, despite expectations the deal could be finalised within months. MPs were briefed on the broad outlines of the TOP SECRET proposed agreement in Canberra last night. Still lots of unanswered questions. The degree of secrecy surrounding the negotiations has been seriously counterproductive to the effort to build a solid political consensus for the agreement. Opponents of free trade in general, and the TPP specifically, have been way out in front on this issue. Even before a text has been sighted, this deal has been given a major thumbs down in the court of public opinion. Lots of sensible economic amd political analysts in the US are also deeply unconvinced that this will be a good agreement.\nThere may not be legislation, or clarity, or even a detailed policy, but there is a meme.\nNow we are through the abomination of question time, let\u2019s work out where various things are up to. I want to walk back to the South China Sea story, one because it\u2019s very important, and two, because there\u2019s an angle I haven\u2019t explored yet. I did mention earlier in the day that Labor\u2019s foreign affiars spokewoman, Tanya Plibersek, has been trying for the past few days to walk a line where she\u2019s behind the government, but also suggesting the government tone down the public lectures to China. Today, Plibersek has toned down her toning down a fraction. Here\u2019s what she said today. Of course, we take no position on the territorial disputes in question, but we do say that it is important to have freedom of navigation and freedom of flight through an area that is an extremely busy trading route, an area that Australian vessels have been traveling through for many years. We urge the parties of course to use international laws and norms to settle any disagreements about sovereignty and of course, it is important that this area remains open to trading. But it\u2019s interesting that Labor\u2019s defence spokesman, Stephen Conroy, is toning down nothing. He backed the legitimacy of Australia\u2019s program to sail and fly through the region. His view today was basically, go for it. Conroy: This is nothing new. Let\u2019s be clear. Australia will continue to travel through internationally recognised waters and we call on all countries that have been constructing artificial islands and reclaiming land to settle this matter through the normal international processes.\nBest take a collection.\nWhy does Bill Shorten want to punish the people of Sydney. The eternal why. Right there.\nHe wouldn\u2019t know a good a good flash if he saw one. Yep, this is your parliament. Further questions have been placed on the notice paper. The quote above is a complaint in response to a complaint about the Liberal MP Brett Whiteley allegedly taking a photo in the chamber. This is banned activity. Manager of opposition business Tony Burke has alleged secret photographic activity. Whitely has refuted the suggestion. You see what he did there, right?\nSocial services minister, Scott Morrison. Way up high. Madam Speaker. Well I\u2019ve been thinking, I\u2019ve been thinking where is this \u2018somehow place\u2019 where you can magically fund all of your commitments? I thought it might be somewhere over the rainbow, Madam Speaker. Way up high, there is a land that I\u2019ve heard of once in a lullaby. That\u2019s what they think, Madam Speaker. They are living in a fantasy land when it comes to how you pay for your budget promises. We\u2019ve got the Wizard of Oz over here, all smoke and mirrors. And it\u2019s time for those opposite, Madam Speaker, to come back to reality \u2013 whether it\u2019s the flying monkeys up the back or cowardly lion or Dorothy herself over here, Madam Speaker. It\u2019s time for her to stand up and tap her shoes together, come back to reality and say there\u2019s no place like home, there\u2019s no place like home.\nWhile I chased down the RBA statement, there were two Dorothy Dixers about radicalisation of young people, and the risks associated with that that phenomenon. Justice minister, Michael Keenan: This government will work with communities to provide the support they need to turn those who would be susceptible away from this dark and violent path.\nTony Abbott, continuing on with Bill Shorten\u2019s secret plan to lower the value of your house. Now, Madam Speaker, let me read from a statement which came out just a few minutes ago from the governor of the Reserve Bank. He said, \u201cCredit is recording moderate growth overall with stronger lending to businesses\u201d, that\u2019s good, \u201cAnd growth in lending to the housing market broadly steady\u201d. Now that\u2019s good too. Now the governor of the Reserve Bank went on to say, \u201cDwelling prices continue to rise strongly in Sydney, though trends have been more varied in a number of other cities\u201d. Let me repeat that, \u201cDwelling prices continue to rise strongly in Sydney, though trends have been more varied in a number of other cities\u201d. Why does this leader of the opposition want to punish the people of Sydney? Why does he want to punish the people of Sydney? The prime minister really should have read on. The next sentence of the RBA statement says this: The Bank is working with other regulators to assess and contain risks that may arise from the housing market. In other asset markets, prices for equities and commercial property have been supported by lower long-term interest rates. Let me repeat. Risks that might arise from the housing market. Funny that bit didn\u2019t get a run.\nBill Shorten is back. Does the prime minister agree there is a housing bubble? Tony Abbott: Madam Speaker, millions of Australians have borrowed money to buy a house. Millions of Australians have mortgages and the last thing they want to see is the decline in the most important asset. The last thing Australians want to see is a decline in the value of their most important asset. That\u2019s the thing, Madam Speaker. And why members opposite should be talking down our economy, why members opposite should be saying that somehow people\u2019s houses are worth too much \u2013 that\u2019s what the leader of the opposition is saying, he is saying that people\u2019s houses are worth too much! Now, Madam Speaker, this is someone who wants to be the prime minister of Australia and he wants your house to be worth less. There\u2019s an obvious commonsense riposte here. Does the treasury secretary, the top economic adviser to the government, want your house to be worth less if he points out there is a housing bubble? Ridiculous, this. But in that compelling way that rank stupidity often is. Coming soon to a talkback radio station near you. Put twenty bucks on it. In the answer before Abbott\u2019s Joe Hockey spoke about the government\u2019s concern about housing affordability. I thought that concern was bipartisan, more or less. Less bipartisan is the government\u2019s \u201ctough stand in relation to foreign investment on residential housing\u201d (Hockey\u2019s words, a policy shift which is ostensibly about keeping residential property afforable for Australian nationals.)\nLabor\u2019s Chris Bowen has a question for the treasurer. Q: I refer to the treasurer\u2019s comments last year that the idea of a housing bubble emerging was a \u201clazy analysis\u201d but yesterday the treasury secretary stated when you look at the evidence, it\u2019s unequivocally the case in Sydney, unequivocal. When it comes to housing prices in Sydney, does the treasurer agree with himself or the secretary to the treasury? Joe Hockey: There is no doubt that since my comments last year, housing prices have increased in Sydney .. (This attracts the predictable gotcha chortling) Hockey: Why are you laughing? What is funny about that? I think we should be welcoming an increase in housing values. You know what? For anyone who has a loan out there, they would be wishing their home is worth more than their loan. That is what they would actually want. (Context: Yesterday, the treasury secretary said there was a housing bubble in Sydney and parts of Melbourne. Yesterday, the prime minister copped some stick for failing to empathise with young would be homeowners who can\u2019t afford a house by saying he was pleased, from a homeowner\u2019s perspective, that Sydney property prices were modestly increasing. Note Hockey\u2019s use of values, not prices.)\nA flash of characteristic enthusiasm from the small business minister Bruce Billson. Then Labor\u2019s Jenny Macklin has returned. She raises the case of a 74 year old carer who stands to lose $100 per week due to cuts in family tax benefit B. How will she manage? Tony Abbott: I make two points in response to the member who asked the question. First of all, as a 70-year-old carer, no doubt she is on a pension and what we have done is we have scrapped the carbon tax and kept the compensation for pensioners and, Madam Speaker, the first thing Labor would do if they came back in is whack the carbon tax straight back on. That\u2019s the first thing that Labor would do. They would whack the carbon tax straight back on. Madam Speaker, when it comes to the family tax benefit Part B, we know that when the member who asked the question was the relevant minister, she cut $15bn. This is followed by a skirmish about whether the word hypocrite is parliamentary.\nTasmanian independent Andrew Wilkie would like a commitment that $16m set aside for a grant to Cadbury will stay in Tasmania now Cadbury isn\u2019t proceeding with its plans. The prime minister said lots of good things are happening in Tasmania, don\u2019t you worry about that.\n\nLabor\u2019s Jenny Macklin asks the prime minister about the ANU work referenced by my colleague Lenore Taylor today. This is the work that broadly backs a recent Natsem analysis of the budget commissioned by the ALP. The prime minister says something rather strange. Madam Speaker, there has been no new analysis, and the analysis that the shadow minister refers to is the old analysis, and the old analysis did not actually analyse the 2015 budget. Simple as that. It did not actually analyse the 2015 budget. To my knowledge, both pieces of work analysed the budget.\nThe next Dorothy Dixer invites the treasurer to reflect on his effort to crack down on tax avoidance by multinationals. Joe Hockey reflects on the deficiency of Labor\u2019s proposal to crack down on avoidance by multinationals.\nDorothy Dixers are starting on the subject of the budget. Labor is persisting with the leaks. Manager of opposition business Tony Burke low balls. Q: Given the minister for foreign affairs is currently overseas, will the prime minister also be talking directly to the foreign minister about the political and personal consequences of leaks from cabinet? Tony Abbott: I would have thought that the opposition would have been very pleased that the foreign minister is doing what she always does, promoting the interests of our country abroad. That\u2019s what she does. She is promoting the interests of our country abroad.\nFirst question is about the leaks. Q: What did the prime minister mean today when he said there would be political and personal consequences for his ministers who leak from cabinet, and what steps has the prime minister taken to identify those ministers on his frontbench who are responsible? The prime minister repeats his formulation from yesterday. The government has a strong and effective policy to keep our country safe. Relevance, says Labor. Sit down, says Madam Speaker. The prime minister ups the rhetorical ante. Anyone who raises a gun or a knife to Australians simply because of who we are and the values we have, has forfeited his or right to consider himself one of us.\nGood God, here\u2019s 2pm. The hour of glower is opening with statements of condolence on the death yesterday of Joan Kirner. Thr prime minister offers a tribute to a community activist and a champion of women\u2019s advancement \u2013 a mentor of the former prime minister Julia Gillard. The Labor leader Bill Shorten says Labor has lost another champion. She once said \u2018There is no such thing as being non-political. By making a decision to stay out of politics, you are making the decision to allow others to shape politics and exert power over you. If you are alienated from the current political system, then just by staying out of it, you do nothing to change it, you simply entrench it.\u2019 We remember her wicked sense of humour, her hatred of pomposity and her love for the Essendon Football Club. Now her battle is over, her duty done, may she rest in peace.\nCheeky I know, but given leaks are clearly the issue du jour, I wonder if this morning\u2019s leak to Greg Sheridan will be investigated by the AFP?\nAs we roll forward on the ramp to question time, the office of the defence minister Kevin Andrews, has issued a second statement on Greg Sheridan\u2019s story regarding the South China Sea. The first Andrews office statement that I posted at around 11.30am this morning seemed to confirm the proposition that the government was actively considering conducting \u201cfreedom of navigation\u201d exercises near artificial islands built by China. The first statement indicated patrols in the area were not unusual, and it is in the interest of all countries to ensure free and unencumbered transit through international waters including those in the South China Sea. Sounded like yes on the Sheridan proposition. Obviously this issue is highly sensitive. This second Andrews office statement walks the first back by arguing patrols are entirely business as usual and there\u2019s been no \u201cformal\u201d talks with Washington. It says new missions haven\u2019t been discussed at the defence secretary level. A spokesperson for Kevin Andrews: It is well known by all countries in the region that Australia has been patrolling the South China Sea from the air for over 30 years as part of Operation Gateway. We\u2019ve been doing it on an ongoing basis since 1980 and will continue to in the future as part of Australia\u2019s enduring contribution to the preservation of regional security and stability in South East Asia. The Australian government has not had formal talks with the United States on \u2018Freedom of Navigation\u2019 missions in the South China Sea. Minister Andrews has met with Secretary Carter twice and the expansion of current operations or new missions in the South China Sea was not discussed. A safe region means a more safe and secure Australia and we will continue to a have a role in that regard.\nWe needed this. We truly did.\nComing to Jesus. #BrickSermon #BrickMount #StopTheLeaks\nSorry, in a mild flap here. People keep sending me funny things about Jesus. We must do the lunchtime summary. Tuesday, this lunchtime. Newspoll shows Labor would win any (hypothetical) election held today, although if we consider the trend, the prime minister will be happy to note a steady decline in Bill Shorten\u2019s approval ratings and a steady incline in his. The prime minister has told colleagues to stop leaking or else, in what has been characterised as a Come to Jesus moment. It is unclear (to me at least) who is Jesus, and who was coming. Conservatives in the Coalition have been keen to smack down the trickle of Coalition MPs now coming forth to support same sex marriage. The party has a policy: marriage is between a man and a woman, and that will remain the policy until further notice. There\u2019s more of course, but that\u2019s the main thrust of the day thus far.\nI should have said: the two big issues currently dividing the government along liberal/conservative lines \u2013 the citizenship revocation proposal and same sex marriage \u2013 didn\u2019t come to Jesus today, at least not substantively. The sermonising rather crowded out other business. They will have to come to Jesus another day.\nA bit more on leaks, and trust. Leaks like the one we saw last week over the citizenship proposal reflect several things at once: they reflect the ventilation of genuinely held, utterly respectable different views on a topic (entirely healthy); they can reflect various personal agendas either disclosed or undisclosed (less healthy). A couple of points can be made about coming to Jesus, whomever Jesus might be in this scenario. If leaks have to stop then they might have to stop across the board. That means sanctioned leaks as well as unsanctioned leaks. Some of the current internal frustration reflects a dynamic where the left hand of the government doesn\u2019t always know what the right hand is doing. Is something true when it hits the Daily Telegraph? Or is it true when its discussed openly at senior levels of the government? Also, as much as we can get preoccupied by intrigue, I\u2019m personally glad that the citizenship proposal has sparked a genuine conversation. It should spark one. It\u2019s a serious expansion of the power of the government over the power of the citizenry. We can also be glad that the discussion is in the public domain. It\u2019s messy for the government, but the end result is in the public interest.\nSo let\u2019s cut through here: Tony Abbott has put MPs on notice that leakers will be held accountable for the consequences of their actions. What does that mean? It means leak, and get caught .. well don\u2019t let the door hit your bum on the way out. The prime minister is attempting to restore message discipline. Problem is when message discipline cracks in a government, it often cracks for good.\nWho is Jesus in this scenario?\n\nMy colleague Shalailah Medhora is down at the Coaliton party room briefing now. #StopTheLeaks is certainly the official version of events.\nReaders who like a dollop of irony with their daily serve of politics may note the lecture against leaking was in fact leaked by busy bees in the Coalition. Busy busy buzz buzz. Leakzzzz.\nThe Labor caucus has concluded its weekly meeting. Bill Shorten seems to be signalling the prime minister\u2019s comments on housing affordability yesterday may get a run around the park at 2pm. (Abbott yesterday stood up for modestly rising house prices, as a Sydney home owner with a bank loan.) Shorten thinks that observation wasn\u2019t entirely empathetic. It was extraordinary to hear Tony Abbott yesterday care more about the increasing value of his own home than for young people trying to break into the property market. As to the substance of what Labor might do about housing affordability, Shorten said it was a complex area but one we must continue to look at and work on. On same sex marriage, Shorten noted that the prime minister had underestimated the Australian peole when he claimed that we can only do one thing at a time. (Abbott said yesterday this week needed to be about the budget, not about marriage equality.) In terms of legislation, Labor will support the government\u2019s medical research future fund - but with amendments to achieve safeguards the prime minister has nominated. Labor will support the small business tax measures from the budget. One MP queried where Labor was up to with senate voting reform. The shadow responsible, Gary Gray, told colleagues this was not the time to go into detail on this issue because the senators were not present in caucus. (Gray and various Labor senators have a profound difference in views about how to proceed on this question.)\nFunny old business, politics. Another former Victorian premier, Jeff Kennett, has paid tribute this morning to Joan Kirner \u2013 the lady he trounced in 1992. Jeff Kennett: In the end we didn\u2019t beat her, her male colleagues beat her. Had she been premier in her own time she would have brought about a whole number of outcomes. Once she got the premiership it was too big a task. She was used by her colleagues. The art of politics, an elixir of truth and self-serving rationalisation. Of course Kirner was handed an impossible job, but Kennett\u2019s depiction of himself as an innocent bystander in her political demise is truly laughable. Kids these days.\nThe defence minister Kevin Andrews has issued a short statement attributable to a spokesperson addressing Greg Sheridan\u2019s story about the South China Sea, and the government actively considering conducting \u201cfreedom of navigation\u201d exercises near artificial islands built by China. Here\u2019s the statement. It is in the interest of all countries to ensure free and unencumbered transit through international waters including those in the South China Sea. Australia will continue to transit the South China Sea, including conducting maritime surveillance missions consistent with our rights under international law, as it has been doing for more than three decades now. That sounds like confirmation to me.\nToday\u2019s conundrum. Does leaking a decision in advance of formal cabinet consideration constitute leaking? One man\u2019s leak is another man\u2019s ..\nI\u2019ve mentioned Tuesday is party room meeting day. Sky News reporter Laura Jayes has a breaking fragment from the Coalition party room meeting downstairs. #StopTheLeaks\nWhile we have five minutes to think, always a wonderful development, it has been interesting to watch the Liberal party\u2019s two traditions slug it out over the past week or so. We have liberalism asserting itself in same sex marriage \u2013 folks favouring a conscience vote (just freedom on principle), and folks favouring a conscience vote in order to achieve something \u2013 an end to state sanctioned discrimination. There\u2019s also a pushback in cabinet and in elements of the backbench against the citizenship revocation proposal on the basis (amongst other things) that it increases the power of government at the expense of the individual. Then we have the party\u2019s conservative instincts playing out with national security, and with the opponents of both a free vote and the principle of marriage equality. The party is in a really profound dialogue with itself. An obvious thought perhaps, but one worth pausing to consider.\nLooking to later, for folks who like some predictability in their live coverage, we have two newsworthy events within the boundary of question time. The Reserve Bank will make a call on interest rates, and we\u2019ll get a minimum wage decision. Foreshadowing. Best live-blogging practice.\nThat Bernard Keane from Crikey is a droll sort.\nLooks like the Essential poll, due out later today, is a bit like the Newspoll. Static. Keane is referencing a habit Peter Van Onselen, the Sky broadcaster and News Corporation columnist, has ahead of the release of the Newspoll each fortnight.\nLike, wow, dude.\nWe did say Canbrrra this morning didn\u2019t we? Labor\u2019s foreign affairs spokeswoman, Tanya Plibersek, braved the doors to speak to reporters this morning on a range of topics. She was asked about Greg Sheridan\u2019s story, which I referenced in the second post this morning \u2013 the one that says the Abbott government is actively considering conducting its own \u201cfreedom of navigation\u201d exercises near artificial islands built by China in disputed territory in the South China Sea. The Sheridan story follows a public criticism of China\u2019s posture earlier this week by the defence minister Kevin Andrews. Plibersek was asked if the freedom of navigation exercises sounded like a good idea. Well, we have sought briefings from the government about the escalation of tensions in the South China Sea. Of course, we take no position on the territorial disputes in question, but we do say that it is important to have freedom of navigation and freedom of flight through an area that is an extremely busy trading route, an area that Australian vessels have been travelling through for many years. We urge the parties of course to use international laws and norms to settle any disagreements about sovereignty and of course, it is important that this area remains open to trading. The very best thing for our region is if all the countries in the region \u2013 is continue to grow economically, to trade freely and to live in peace and harmony. Q: Do you think China should halt land reclamation? Well, as I say, we don\u2019t have a position on any of the territorial disputes but it is plainly making some of China\u2019s neighbours anxious, and I think it\u2019s a matter for China and those neighbours to settle peacefully using international laws and norms. (Plibersek has been trying to walk a line this week where she\u2019s rebuking the Abbott government for its activism on this question, but in a fairly careful diplomatic formulation. Plibersek is stronger in referencing the concerns that China\u2019s actions are causing regionally than she was yesterday, but she\u2019s still in the \u201ctone it down\u201d camp. The biggest concern about China weaponising the artificial islands is in Washington of course. It\u2019s fair to assume the Abbott government\u2019s actvisim reflects that particular concern.)\nIn Melbourne, the Victorian premier Daniel Andrews is paying tribute to Joan Kirner. Andrews says it is always very challenging and when you are elevated to this great office \u2013 in very difficult circumstances as well. It wasn\u2019t easy but never a complaint, no bitterness, no sense of focussing on herself, always about working hard for others, always about supporting those in the community who are vulnerable. Andrews says Kirner has left nine women in the Victorian cabinet. A figher, a person of great authenticity. That\u2019s why we loved her.\nAnother asylum boat has been turned back. Apparently this vessel was trying to get to New Zealand. George Roberts from the ABC has the story. Indonesian police say a boat carrying 65 asylum seekers has crashed onto a reef after being turned back by Australian authorities. Those aboard \u2014 54 Sri Lankans, 10 Bangladeshis, one person from Myanmar and five additional crew \u2014 told Indonesian police they were trying to get to New Zealand. There were four women and three toddlers on board. They are now being held on Rote Island off West Timor after crashing onto a reef near the remote Landuti Island.\nAs the prime minister reminds us, this is the budget session. My colleague Lenore Taylor has an interesting tale this morning. A second group of academics have broadly confirmed the conclusions last week from a Natsem analysis of the budget. The Natsem analysis (commissioned by Labor) found low-income families could lose $3,734 in 2015-16, equating to more than $70 a week, under measures in this year\u2019s budget and those still pending from last year, while families on incomes of more than $120,000 were left marginally better off. The government blasted the study. Tony Abbott said the Labor party had \u201cused and abused\u201d Natsem for political purposes. The new work from ANU examined the overall cost of the packages on childcare assistance and family tax cuts and concluded \u201cthe total volume of assistance for families is going down. To assess the overall household impact of the budget, it is necessary to balance who wins from the generally progressive child care assistance proposals versus who loses from last year\u2019s and the new savings proposals.\u201d The government has begun the post budget effort with the small business package. Those measures have broad support in the parliament. There are other fights to follow. The families package is of course fight central.\nYou are now up-to-date with the Liberal MP Sarah Henderson adding her voice to the equal marriage push. Last night on the Q&A program, Josh Frydenberg, the assistant treasurer and supporter of same-sex marriage, supported the conscience vote. Frydenberg has been rebuked this morning for that frankness by fellow Liberal and ACT senator Zed Seselja. Seselja told reporters the Liberal party has a policy on marriage \u2013 marriage is between a man and a woman. The party also has a tradition, ministers support the government\u2019s position. Seselja: I don\u2019t think we should have ministers go against party policy. Seselja\u2019s Senate colleague, Victorian Liberal Scott Ryan, was asked about the rebuke to Frydenberg a few moments ago on Sky News. Ryan says he can\u2019t really respond, because he didn\u2019t watch Q&A. Ryan: I didn\u2019t watch Q&A. I find my weeks start better when I don\u2019t watch it. (I hear you, Scott.)\nCitizenship is still thundering around the building. Cabinet met last night, and it being Tuesday, the Coalition party room meets later today. Government backbenchers are making their views known. Yesterday we had contributions in favour of stripping the citizenship of alleged jihadists, whether they had dual nationalities or not. We also had Cory Bernardi expressing the small government view: we should not give the government power to remove citizenship when there is a risk a person could be rendered stateless. As a matter of principle, I think it\u2019s absolutely wrong for us to take away citizenship from an individual whose sole citizenship is Australian. And particularly be able to do it without any reference to a court of law, at the arbitrary whim of the minister, I think the principle is entirely wrong. Now another backbencher, Sharman Stone, wants to talk about English language training as a requirement of Australian citizenship. By not requiring basic English-language skills as a requirement of citizenship I think we are missing opportunities to help these new citizens get the skills that will help them get a decent job, or help their children in school and ultimately we are risking that they become alienated and discontented. They are often people from Middle Eastern countries and very often women. I am particularly concerned about women from cultural backgrounds that prefer them to stay at home, this might be their only chance to be allowed to learn English. Forty backbenchers have signed a letter to the prime minister calling for strong action to strip people of their nationalities if they are involved in jihadism.\nTo same sex marriage now, which was the major political story yesterday. After the Labor leader Bill Shorten proceeded with his private member\u2019s bill to legalise gay unions, Liberal backbencher Sarah Henderson has emerged to throw her support behind same-sex marriage. She told ABC 24 on Tuesday morning that she reached that conclusion after extensive consultations with her Victorian constituents. \u201cI hadn\u2019t reached a position publicly but I\u2019m pleased to make it known that I will support not only same-sex marriage but, of course, a free vote,\u201d she said, adding that there is a \u201csignificant shift\u201d from the conservative side of politics to embrace the issue. But she insisted that legislation that is eventually passed be bipartisan. \u201cI support a bill coming into the parliament that\u2019s sponsored by the Greens, our side of politics and also Labor.\u201d\nTributes have flowed overnight and this morning for the former Victorian premier Joan Kirner, who died yesterday, aged 76.\nClick on the link in the tweet. Yes, that is the two J\u2019s \u2013 Joan and Julia. Rock on ladies. Rock on. Kirner was a thoroughly wonderful woman who was called to lead Labor in Victoria after the blokes had comprehensively botched the job (familiar trajectory, that). She also made it her business to ensure other women had the chance to enter politics and rise to positions of influence. Kirner was truly assiduous on that point, which makes her a stand out in the selfish and narcissistic game that is politics. One of her friends, the former prime minister Julia Gillard, highlighted that particular contribution in her tribute. Julia Gillard: For a generation of Labor women, including me, she was an inspiration and a mentor. We admired her stoicism. We celebrated her policy achievements. We were guided by her wisdom. After her time as premier, Joan could have chosen a quieter and easier life. But that simply would not have been Joan. Instead, her generosity of spirit and capacity for hard work meant her formidable energy went into ensuring more Labor women entered parliament.\nWithout doubt the most eye catching story of the morning belongs to The Australian\u2019s Greg Sheridan. If you were with me on Politics Live yesterday you\u2019ll know we referenced rising concerns about China\u2019s territorial ambitions in the South China Sea. Well, take it away Greg: The Abbott government is \u00adactively considering conducting its own \u201cfreedom of navigation\u201d exercises near artificial islands built by China in disputed territory in the South China Sea. The government is understood to be examining all options but the most likely appears to be a flight by a P-3 maritime reconnaissance aircraft, perhaps flying out of the former Australian base at Butterworth in northern Malaysia. The Royal Australian Air Force aircraft would fly within 12 nautical miles (22km) of an artificial island built by the Chinese, with Beijing certain to react. It could expect the same Chinese reaction as the US received when it flew a P-8 reconnaissance craft over Fiery Cross Reef in the Spratly Islands on May 20 with a CNN crew aboard to take footage of Beijing\u2019s massive building works, sand dredging and land reclamation. The Chinese repeatedly ordered the Americans to \u201cleave immediately\u201d but did not take any other actions. Canberra\u2019s defence establishment made it quite clear at senate estimates yesterday that it regards China weaponising islands as a significant (negative) escalation of activity in the region. Hugh White, professor of strategic studies at the ANU, has been on the ABC this morning, noting there has been a lot of chatter between Canberra and Washington about China\u2019s activities. White thinks, however, that Australia should not go down the path Sheridan is foreshadowing. If Australia escalates, then it has to persist and have a clear end game. If it eascalates and then withdraws, then it looks weak. Hugh White: I think it\u2019s a very unwise step to take.\nGood morning and welcome to Tuesday in Canbrrrrrrrra.\nWe are a brisk minus six at kick off, with clear skies and a chance of hubris. Given we\u2019ve started with metrics, let\u2019s look at this morning\u2019s Newspoll, which reinforces the lack of a discernible budget bounce for the Coalition. I know it\u2019s a bit silly to speak about budget bounces, given they exist more in mythology than in reality, but it\u2019s not silly to check regularly whether the budget is delivering any political dividend for the Coalition, because the government certainly framed the economic statement to deliver a political dividend. Thus far, not much dividend, apart from Tony Abbott\u2019s personal satisfaction rating, which has been tracking slowly upwards over the past few Newspolls \u2013 although not in this fortnightly survey. Bill Shorten\u2019s satisfaction rating is trending in the other direction. Shorten\u2019s satisfaction rating fell three points this survey fortnight to 32 per cent and is down 10 points since the beginning of the year. While the prime minister and his staff will be cheered by that, Labor is still ahead on the two preferred measure at 52% to the Coaliton\u2019s 48%. On that distribution, Labor wins any (hypothetical) election held today. The poll does reinforce an obvious fact: Labor and Bill Shorten thus far have been surfing on the pervasive anti-Abbott sentiment out in the community. (Manager of government business Christopher Pyne taunted Shorten about this yesterday in the House \u2013 he\u2019d been on the banana lounge with a milkshake, fantasising about leading the country. Time to wake up Bill. Winter is coming.) The prime minister will probably never be liked, but he\u2019s beginning to stabilise and reset some of the perceptions, which puts Shorten in more difficult terrain. While governments lose elections more often than oppositions win them, opposition leaders do have to cut through. Voters have to understand broadly who they are and where they are coming from. Tony Abbott understood this when he transformed himself from roving loose cannon to slogan machine. Shorten right now is clearly looking for opportunities to cut through. Monday\u2019s sortie with his same sex marriage private members bill is doubtless a case in point. Lots more to get across, so we\u2019d best get on. The comments thread is open for business.

The move is a direct consequence of Edward Snowden\u2019s revelations about the scale of electronic monitoring by the US National Security Agency (NSA) and Britain\u2019s GCHQ. The resolution, passed by the council in Geneva on Thursday, was spearheaded by Germany and Brazil, two of the countries where public debate over surveillance has been most intense as a consequence of the Snowden disclosures. There had been concern that the US and the UK, both members of the 47-member council, might try to block the move or attempt to substantially change the language, but in the end the resolution was adopted by consensus, without a vote. The rapporteur, who is set to be appointed in June, will have the remit to monitor, investigate and report on privacy issues and offer advice to governments about compliance. They will also look into alleged violations. Although the right to privacy is enshrined in international law \u2013 it is set out in article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights \u2013 it has largely been ignored and is low on the list of UN priorities. The Snowden revelations changed this dynamic, producing a strong reaction in Germany, given its history of surveillance by the Stasi secret police and the disclosure that the NSA had hacked the mobile phone of the chancellor, Angela Merkel. In Brazil, the president, Dilma Rousseff, cancelled a visit to Washington in protest over spying on her country. The resolution, \u201cThe right to privacy in the digital age\u201d, notes that \u201cthe rapid pace of technological development enables individuals all over the world to use new information and communications technology and at the same time enhances the capacity of governments, companies and individuals to undertake surveillance, interception and data collection, which may violate or abuse human rights\u201d and describes the issue as one of increasing concern. It expresses deep concern \u201cat the negative impact that surveillance and/or interception of communications, including extraterritorial surveillance and/or interception of communications, as well as the collection of personal data, in particular when carried out on a mass scale, may have on the exercise and enjoyment of human rights\u201d. The campaign group Privacy International has been lobbying for such a resolution since 2013. Tomaso Falchetta, legal officer for PI, said: \u201cNow, perhaps more than ever, we need a dedicated individual to hold those accountable who wish to violate privacy, whether it is through surveillance, indiscriminate data collection, or other techniques that infringe on this important right.\u201d Another privacy group, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the decision was a key step forward for the UNHRC. \u201cIt elevates the right to privacy to the priority level that the human rights council ascribes to most other human rights. Most importantly, it gives the right to privacy the international recognition and protection it deserves.\u201d However, the foundation said the resolution alone would not prevent countries from conducting mass surveillance. \u201cNow the onus rests on all of us to bring unchecked surveillance cases to the attention of the new special rapporteur.\u201d Rapporteurs are not UN staff members and are independent of the organisation after the initial appointment.\n", "title": "UN sets up privacy rapporteur role in wake of Snowden leaks"}, {"date": "2015-11-04T20:29:30Z", "body": "Theresa May, the home secretary, has published long-awaited plans to update surveillance legislation. In the Commons the draft investigatory powers bill was broadly welcomed by MPs, with the Labour party provisionally supporting the plans, but as experts study the small print, potential drawbacks have emerged. This afternoon Liberty, the human rights pressure group, said May was wrong to claim that she was giving judges the power to authorise interception warrants for the first time in centuries. Shami Chakrabarti, the Liberty director, said that in practice judges would only have very limited powers to block warrant decisions taken by ministers. See 4.30pm. Number 10 has announced that flights to Sharm el-Sheikh have been suspended because the British government thinks the Russian plane that crashed after leaving the airport may have been brought down by a bomb. Here is the Number 10 statement. The Prime Minister called President Sisi yesterday evening to discuss what measures the Egyptians are taking to ensure the tightest possible security arrangements at Sharm el-Sheikh airport. While the investigation is still ongoing we cannot say categorically why the Russian jet crashed. But as more information has come to light we have become concerned that the plane may well have been brought down by an explosive device. In light of this and as a precautionary measure we have decided that flights due to leave Sharm for the UK this evening will be delayed. That will allow time for a team of UK aviation experts, currently travelling to Sharm, to make an assessment of the security arrangements in place at the airport and to identify whether any further action is required. We expect this assessment to be completed tonight. In terms of flights from the UK to Sharm, there are no more departures today. We would underline that this is a precautionary step and we are working closely with the airlines on this approach. The Prime Minister will chair a COBR at 18.45 to review the situation and we will provide an update after that meeting. We recognise that this information may cause concern for those in Sharm and indeed for those planning to travel to Sharm in the coming days. We have deployed extra consular staff to Sharm who will be on hand at the airport, working with the airlines, to assist British holidaymakers there. For others, either in resorts at Sharm or planning a holiday to Sharm in the coming days, our advice is to contact your airline or tour operator. At this stage we are not changing the level of our Travel Advice. David Cameron has confirmed he is looking at ways to get private investment into Channel 4, after months of speculation that the government is looking at selling off all or part of the broadcaster. Cameron has dismissed questions from Jeremy Corbyn about a looming winter crisis in the NHS and the impact of cuts to tax credits by joking about Labour\u2019s move to the left under the new leader. The government has backed down on its plan to allow fracking in some of England\u2019s most important nature sites. The controversial technique for extracting shale gas will not be allowed in Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) after all, ministers said on Wednesday, after previously opening the door to fracking in such sites in July. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments.\nEdward Snowden, the NSA whistleblower, has been posting more tweets about the bill.\nHere is a, fairly random, selection of Tweets about the draft bill from journalists and others. From the Guardian\u2019s George Monbiot\nFrom Henry Porter\nFrom Tom Newton Dunn\nFrom David Allen Green, the FT\u2019s legal commentator\nFrom the author Robert Harris\nFrom the barrister Matthew Ryder\nNCND means \u201cneither confirm nor deny\u201d.\nFrom Charles Arthur, the technology journalist\nFrom Ryan Gallagher, a journalist at The Intercept\nShami Chakrabarti, the Liberty director, has just been on BBC News making the same point David David Davis has been making. (See 4.20pm.) She said: I\u2019m hugely disappointed with this bill ... I have to tell you there is no judicial authorisation for interception in this bill. At most, there is a very, very limited role for judges in a rubber-stamping exercise. It is not judicial sign-off, it is not acceptable in a modern democracy ... They have spun it as a double lock, but the second person, the judge, does not actually have a key. She also claimed that the bill gave the bill \u201cbreath-taking\u201d hacking powers. Equally, we now have new powers of hacking, breath-taking new powers for the police and the authorities to hack into our systems and servers and devices in a way that leaves us all more permanently vulnerable to hacking, including from fraudsters and terrorists. This is a very, very flawed piece of legislation.\nAnd here is the quote from the Conservative MP David Davis about what he sees as the flaw in Theresa May\u2019s \u201cdouble lock\u201d proposal for judicial authorisation. (See 1.45pm and 3.25pm.) I draw everybody\u2019s attention to section 19(2), which tells the judicial commissioners they have to make decisions based on judicial review principles, not on the basis of the evidence. In other words the home secretary would have to behave in an extraordinary manner not to get his or her warrant approved. This is not the judge checking the evidence, it is the judge checking that the correct procedure has been followed. This is not quite the protection it was represented as.\nThis is significant.\nPatrick Wintour and Henry Porter are both making the point that Labour\u2019s response to the draft bill today (see 1pm) represents something of a Jeremy Corbyn climbdown.\nAndy Burnham, the shadow home secretary, has just told BBC News that Labour will not play party politics with this if the government is getting it right \u201cand they are getting it right on this\u201d.\nDavid Anderson QC, the independent reviewer of terror legislation whose landmark report A Question of Trust had considerable influence on the draft regulatory powers bill published today, has posted a more detailed response to it on his website. Here are some of the key points he is making. Anderson welcomes the fact the bill will give parliament the chance to decide properly what surveillance powers the authorities should have. The best thing about the Bill is that it puts Parliament in charge. For the first time, we have a Bill that sets out, for public and political debate, the totality of the investigatory powers used or aspired to by police and intelligence agencies. The list includes: some functions that were publicly avowed only a few months ago (\u201cequipment interference\u201d, including in bulk and by the police, and the use of bulk personal datasets); one function that was avowed only today \u2013 the use of section 94 of the Telecommunications Act 1984 for the bulk collection of communications data for the use of the intelligence agencies; and a proposal for police access to internet connection records for defined purposes, a watered-down version of proposals made in 2012 and never progressed because of Coalition disagremeents. It is accompanied by the operational case that I described as the minimum starting-point for a debate on this subject \u2013 published so that it can be scrutinised by all. Not everyone will be happy about those powers. It will now be for Parliament to decide whether they are justified. That is the way things should be in a democracy \u2013 but rarely are at the moment, anywhere in the world. Whatever the content of the eventual UK law, it will no longer be possible to describe it as opaque, incomprehensible or misleading. He welcomes the fact that, for the first time in more than 300 years, the bill will stop interception warrants being issued without judicial involvement. There will be a powerful, outward-facing super-regulator, and save in urgent cases, no warrant will enter into force without judicial approval \u2013 a reversal of consistent practice since at least the 17th century. He questions whether the safeguards go far enough. Opinions will differ as to whether these safeguards go far enough. The judges need to be well-supported, and exposed to a sufficiently wide range of opinion for there to be no question of them operating as rubber stamps. It also needs to be asked whether there is sufficient independence in procedures for access to communications data, bearing in mind in particular the Digital Rights Ireland judgment on whose meaning the European Court of Justice has recently been asked to pronounce, and the particularly sensitive or intrusive nature of some data (for example, the fact that a lawyer may have communicated with a potential witness). (In his report he said judges, not politicians, should be in charge of signing interception warrants. Theresa May\u2019s \u201cdouble-lock\u201d approach - see 1.25pm - is a compromise.) He says he will be giving interviews tonight but that after that he won\u2019t be commenting further. I did my best to inform the debate (with the help of my small but diverse team) but that debate is now open to all, as it should be, and I hope as many knowledgeable people as possible will participate in it.\nThis is useful, although you will probably need GCHQ-grade magnifying equipment to actually read it.\nAlternatively, you can find it on page 33 of the draft bill (pdf).\nDavid Davis is also complaining that the communications data of MPs - the record of who they contacted by phone etc, not the content of those communications - is not protected.\nEdward Snowden, the NSA whistleblower, has been tweeting about the draft bill.\nIn the Commons David Davis, the Conservative MP and leading libertarian campaigner, said that Theresa May\u2019s proposal for a double lock, requiring interception warrants to be signed by judges as well as ministers, did not go far enough. May should accept the proposal in David Anderson\u2019s A Question of Trust report and put judges in charge, he said. The claimed concession by the Home Office that an after-the-event check by judges for ministerial warrants is a retreat from the recommendations of the Government\u2019s own independent reviewer of counter terrorism legislation, David Anderson QC, namely that domestic warrants should be judicially authorised. Judges are extremely unlikely to overrule a Home Secretary once he or she has already taken a decision. At the weekend Davis said he did not think the bill would get through the Commons without judicial authorisation. Whether or not MPs decide that May\u2019s compromise proposal amounts to proper judicial authorisation remains to be seen.\nSara Thornton, chair of the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council, said the police needed new powers to access information. We use our powers of investigation, like access to communications data, to protect the public, preserve life and prevent and detect crime. Our capabilities have not kept up with changes in technology and how people communicate, meaning there are more and more blind-spots where we can\u2019t trace criminal activity or find crucial information to protect people at risk of harm. With independent scrutiny and authorisation, we need to be able to pursue investigative leads in a digital space by requesting information about where people are connecting to the internet; who they are speaking to and the sites they are visiting but not the content of what is said. This is the modern equivalent of using phone numbers in a targeted way to find out who someone has called or texted; a simple investigative capability that has been accepted for many years.\nJulian Huppert, the former Lib Dem MP, sat on the joint committee that considered the 2012 draft communications data bill. He was highly critical of the proposed 2012 legislation. This is what he is saying about the draft investigatory powers bill.\nIn the Commons Nick Clegg, the former Lib Dem leader, was relatively positive about the draft communications data bill. (See 1.09pm.) But his successor, Tim Farron, is striking a different tone on Twitter.\nBig Brother Watch, another privacy campaign group, has raised concerns about the draft bill, although it is not as critical as Liberty (see 2.19pm). This is from Renate Samson, its chief executive. The recommendation of a \u2018double lock\u2019 of political and judicial sign off on the most intrusive powers appears to tick the box of independent judicial approval, but in a world which is increasingly connected online the future demands on a home secretary\u2019s time could become impractical. Requests for retention of internet connection records will provide access to the most detailed data on citizens, not just the who and when of a telephone record, but the what and how of the way we live our lives. The guarantee of security to this retained data will be critical. Furthermore, demands on technology companies to adhere to warrants for encrypted data, as well as the power to legally hack into our devices, could create legislative back doors which in a world of increased cyber-attack could make us more vulnerable to crime. There is a great deal to be scrutinised in a very short space of time. For this legislation to really be a world leader in how to protect the privacy and security of law-abiding citizens, the bill will require a thorough investigation.\nBen Emmerson QC, UN special rapporteur on counter-terrorism and human rights, whose report to the UN general assembly last year described mass surveillance by intelligence agencies as \u201ccorrosive of online privacy\u201d, expressed disappointment that May did not opt to transfer more power to judges. Commenting on the draft bill, he said: Judicial review after the event is better than no judicial review at all. But it falls short of the putting the power to issue a warrant in the first place into the hands of an independent judge, which is where it belongs.\nThis illustrates very well the difference between an internet connection record, which Theresa May said would not give the police access to people\u2019s \u201cfull web browsing histories\u201d (see 1.45pm), and a full browsing history.\nA Microsoft spokesperson offered a tentative welcome to the bill while adding caveats about private data and protection for customers. The Microsoft spokesperson said: We think any reform must ensure a strong role for the courts in the authorisation of access to private data and avoid conflicts with the laws of other nations. We appreciate the government\u2019s willingness to engage in an open debate about these important issues, and as this process unfolds, we will work to ensure that legislation respects these principles and protects the privacy of our customers.\nThe Open Rights Group, a privacy pressure group, has also criticsed the draft bill. This is from its executive director, Jim Killock. This bill will redefine the relationship between the state and the public for a generation. The government needs to get it right and made sure that the UK\u2019s law enforcement and security agencies can fight serious crime while upholding all of our human rights. However, at first glance, it appears that this bill is an attempt to grab even more intrusive surveillance powers and does not do enough to restrain the bulk collection of our personal data by the secret services. It proposes an increase in the blanket retention of our personal communications data, giving the police the power to access web logs. It also gives the state intrusive hacking powers that can carry risks for everyone\u2019s Internet security. The joint committee must now listen to the concerns of activists and the public if they are to restore trust in the police and security services.\nIn the Commons MPs who in the past have been very critical of Theresa May on internet surveillance, like David Davis and Nick Clegg, were relatively positive about the proposals. But Liberty has criticised them strongly. This is from Shami Chakrabarti, the Liberty director. After all the talk of climbdowns and safeguards, this long-awaited bill constitutes a breath-taking attack on the internet security of every man, woman and child in our country. We must now look to parliament to step in where ministers have failed and strike a better balance between privacy and surveillance.\nIn his story my colleague Alan Travis says that Theresa May\u2019s statement contained an admission that communications data has been handed over to the security services in bulk since 1984. In her statement, May also revealed for the first time that successive governments since 1994 have issued secret directions to internet and phone companies to hand over the communications data of British citizens in bulk to the security services. She said these secret \u201cdirections\u201d had allowed the security services to thwart a number of attacks in Britain, including the plot to attack the London Stock Exchange in 2010. May revealed that the use of these powers \u2013 which show that GCHQ was also engaged in mass surveillance programmes on British citizens using their communications data \u2013 under the 1984 Telecommunications Act will be put on a more explicit footing in the new legislation and be subject to the same safeguards as other bulk powers. This is the point that David Anderson, the independent reviewer of terror legislation, was referring to in his \u201cavowal\u201d tweet. See 2.01pm.\nDavid Anderson, the independent reviewer of terror legislation, says on Twitter that he will be responding to the draft bill on the PM programme after 5pm. But, judging by what he has been tweeting, he seems quite pleased with it. Here are some of those tweets.\nAnd Anderson retweeted this.\n(What this means is that GCHQ has been hoovering up bulk data for years, but that at least this bill is explicit about this, and that that is a good thing.)\nSteve McCabe, a Labour MP, asks why internet companies are being asked to retain web browsing information for 12 months. May says 12 months that current obligations on data retention apply for. It was felt 24 months would be too long, she says.\nHere are the main points from Theresa May\u2019s statement. May insisted that today\u2019s draft bill was quite different from the 2012 draft communications data bill that was branded the snoopers\u2019 charter. Let me be clear, the draft Bill we are publishing today is not a return to the draft Communications Data Bill of 2012. It will not include powers to force UK companies to capture and retain third party internet traffic from companies based overseas. It will not compel overseas communications service providers to meet our domestic retention obligations for communications data. And it will not ban encryption or do anything to undermine the security of people\u2019s data. And the substance of all of the recommendations by the Joint Scrutiny Committee which examined that draft Bill have been accepted. So today\u2019s Bill represents a significant departure from the proposals of the past. She said the government was not proposing to give the police access to people\u2019s full web browsing history. Mr Speaker, some have characterised this power as law enforcement having access to people\u2019s full web browsing histories. Let me be clear \u2013 this is simply wrong. An Internet Connection Record is a record of the communications service that a person has used, not a record of every web page they have accessed. So, if someone has visited a social media website, an Internet Connection Record will only show that they accessed that site, not the particular pages they looked at, who they communicated with, or what they said. It is simply the modern equivalent of an itemised phone bill. She said \u201cstrict limits\u201d would apply to when the police could access this information. Law enforcement agencies would not be able to make a request for the purpose of determining \u2013 for example \u2013 whether someone had visited a mental health website, a medical website or even a news website. They would only be able to make a request for the purpose of determining whether someone had accessed a communications website, an illegal website or to resolve an IP address where it is necessary and proportionate to do so in the course of a specific investigation. She confirmed that a new \u201cdouble lock\u201d would apply to the issuing of warrants allowing the interception of communications. While there was a good deal of agreement in the three independent reviews I have referenced, all three reached different conclusions on the question of who should authorise interception warrants. The Intelligence and Security Committee supported authorisation by a Secretary of State. David Anderson said judges should carry out the authorisation. And RUSI said the authorisation of warrants should have a judicial element, but also recognised the important role of the Secretary of State. I have considered the very good arguments put forward by the three reviews. My response is one that I hope the House agrees will provide the reassurance of both democratic accountability and judicial accountability. So, as now, the Secretary of State will need to be satisfied that an activity is necessary and proportionate before a warrant can be issued. But in future, the warrant will not come into force until it has been formally approved by a judge. This will place a \u201cdouble lock\u201d on the authorisation of our most intrusive investigatory powers. Democratic accountability, through the Secretary of State, to ensure our intelligence agencies operate in the interests of the citizens of this country, and the public reassurance of independent, judicial authorisation. This will be one of the strongest authorisation regimes anywhere in the world. She said the prime minister would have to approve any warrant to intercept the communications of an MP. For Parliamentarians we will go even further. This Bill will for the first time put into law the Prime Minister\u2019s commitment that in any case where it is proposed to intercept the communications of a Parliamentarian \u2013 including members of this House, members of the House of Lords, UK MEPs and the members of the devolved legislatures \u2013 the Prime Minister would also be consulted. She claimed the new oversight arrangements - involving a new investigatory powers commissioner - would be \u201cworld-leading\u201d. I am clear we need a significantly strengthened regime to govern how these powers are authorised and overseen. So we will replace the existing oversight with a powerful and independent Investigatory Powers Commissioner. This will be a senior judge, supported by a team of expert inspectors with the authority and resources to effectively, and visibly, hold the intelligence agencies and law enforcement to account. These will be world-leading oversight arrangements. She claimed the draft bill contained some of the \u201cstrongest protections and safeguards\u201d in the world. Today, we are setting out a modern legal framework which brings together current powers in a clear and comprehensible way. A new Bill that provides some of the strongest protections and safeguards anywhere in the democratic world. And an approach that sets new standards for openness, transparency and oversight. She said the draft bill would be scrutinised by a joint committee of MPs and peers and that a revised bill would then come to parliament in the spring, with a view to it becoming law before the end of 2016.\nAndrew Mitchell, the former international development secretary, says he used to sign warrants when he was in government on behalf of May and others. He says he backs the \u201cdual key\u201d approach proposed by May. But he wants an assurance that the judges authorising warrants are seen as independent, and that they are not judges seen as too close to the police. May agrees with this point.\nDavid Winnick, the Labour MP, says he is concerned about the \u201cexcessive powers\u201d being given to the security services. If this were to be passed without amendment, it would be a \u201cbitter blow to civil liberties\u201d. Can I tell you that I remain concerned, even though I\u2019m one of the few who do remain concerned, about the excessive powers which will be given to the security authorities in addition to what they already have, though judicial involvement is better than no judicial involvement. There\u2019s a good deal of concern outside of this House and I certainly do consider if this measure was to be passed along the same lines without substantial amendments it would be very unfortunate and a bitter blow for civil liberties. May says Winnick claimed there were substantial new powers in the bill. He is wrong, she says. Most of the powers in the bill exist in current legislation, she says. But she admits that the powers relating to the retention of internet browsing history are new. May says most of the powers given to the police and intelligence services in the draft bill are not new.\nHere\u2019s a clip from May\u2019s statement.\nKeith Vaz, the Labour chair of the home affairs committee, asks who will train the judges to do this work. May says this is not the first time judges have been asked to take on new national security responsibilities. Judges are used to taking difficult decisions, she says. She says she has more faith in the judiciary than perhaps Vaz does.\nOwen Paterson, the Conservative former Northern Ireland secretary, says he is worried that the \u201cdouble-lock\u201d process for warrants will slow things down. He suggests it would be better to carry on with the existing system. I believe strongly these decisions should be made by an elected member of this House, accountable to this House, and accountable to committees such as the ISC. I am concerned that involving another decision maker from the judiciary, who may not have particular skills in this area, will bring delay and will bring complication. How many hours after an early morning decision by a secretary of state will there be scrutiny by a judge? May says the question about timeliness is a good one. There will be guidelines saying how quickly judges need to respond to requests for a warrant. But there will be a provision allowing a secretary of state to approve a warrant in an emergency. When this happens, a judge will have to confirm it within five days.\nIn response to a question from the SNP\u2019s Joanna Cherry, May says there is a \u201cquestion mark\u201d over whether a legislative consent motion is required for this bill (ie, whether the Scottish parliament has to approve it because it covers devolved matters).\nThe home secretary revealed for the first time in her statement that successive governments since 1994 have issued secret directions to internet and phone companies to hand over the communications data of British citizens in bulk to the security services. She said these secret \u201cdirections\u201d had allowed the security services to thwart a number of attacks in Britain, including the plot to attack the London Stock Exchange in 2010. May said the use of these powers \u2013 which show that GCHQ was also engaged in mass surveillance programmes on British citizens using their communications data \u2013 under the 1984 Telecommunications Act will be put on a more explicit footing in the new legislation and be subject to the same safeguards as other bulk powers.\nAnd here is the full text of Theresa May\u2019s statement on the draft bill.\nHere is the 299-page draft investigatory powers bill (pdf). And here is the page on the Home Office website with links to more than 20 documents being published alongside the bill.\nNick Clegg, the former Lib Dem leader, says this bill is a \u201cmuch improved model\u201d compared to the 2012 draft bill, although he says he thinks there may be flaws \u201cunder the bonnet\u201d. He says the double-lock compromise on judicial authorisation is a compromise. But it may be cumbersome. Why did May rule out simple judicial authorisiation. He says the provisions on internet browsing data are a big improvement on the 2012 bill. May says not all the reports about the draft bill that appeared before today were the result of briefing. Some of the most contentious plans from the 2012 model, such as the retention of third party data, have been dropped. She says, if a child is abducted, the police can see from their phone records who they were in contact with. But currently the police cannot see who they contacted via the internet.\nMay welcomes the tone of Burnham\u2019s response. But she says that she does not accept what Burnham said about David Cameron. She says she has discussed this with David Anderson. It is not for her to say what he thinks, but she has taken on board most of his recommendations. She says the content-interception plans will only cover serious crimes, as now. On encryption, she says the government is not banning encryption. But it is asking providers to take reasonable steps to be able to read communications. She says there will be something in the bill saying that judicial authorisation is needed for the police to access a journalist\u2019s source. On the double lock, she says both the judge and the secretary of state will have to approve a warrant. But there will be a process where a warrant applies after a secretary of state has approved it, provided that a judge subsequently confirms it.\nAndy Burnham, the shadow home secretary, says May has been listening to the concerns expressed in the last parliament. She has brought forward stronger safeguards, he says. He says it would help if MPs sent out a unified message that this is neither a snoopers\u2019 charter nor a plan for mass surveillance. Has David Anderson expressed a view on the draft bill? Can May assure MPs that the powers for content-interception will only be used for the most serious crimes? What information will be stored by internet firms? Does May understand the concern the TalkTalk hack has generated? If this bill does not apply to firms overseas, doesn\u2019t that create a large hole? Will there be voluntary arrangements covering them? Will there be protection for journalists too? Burnham says he is pleased to see that May has shifted on authorisation. But having a two-stage process could bring in time delays? So how will it work? And what happens if the secretary of state and the judge come to different conclusions? Who will have the final say? He says there are fears in the Muslim community that these powers will be used against them. It does not help when the prime minister implies Muslims condone extremism. And there fears about these powers being used against trade unionists. So will the government drop some of its more divisive measures, including those in the trade union bill. Burnham says the plans in this bill go beyond party politics. He says May has \u201cresponded to legitimate concerns and broadly got that balance right\u201d. Burnham says May has \u201cbroadly\u201d got the balance right. He says the draft bill does not amount to a snoopers\u2019 charter or mass surveillance.\nMay says there will be a \u201cdouble-lock\u201d process applying before the most intrusive warrants are approved. They will have to be approved by a secretary of state, but then confirmed by a judge too. This will be one of the strongest authorisation arrangements in the world, she says. And there will be extra protection for MPs and members of the devolved legislatures. The prime minister would have to approve a warrant approving them, he says. May says any interception warrant covering an MP would have be be approved by prime minister.\nMay says there will be new oversight arrangements - a new commissioner, she says. These will be \u201cworld-leading\u201d oversight arrangements, she says.\nMay says the bill will make explicit provision for the intelligence agencies to acquire information in bulk. This is not a new power. It will replace a power under the Telecommunications Act 1984. Bulk communications data has played a huge role in investigating terror attacks, she says. These powers do not cover content, she says.\nMay says a transparency report is being published with the bill today.\nBack in the Commons May says the provisions about accessing internet browsing history are just the modern equivalent of allowing the authorities to see an itemised phone bill.\nHere is the first take of my colleague Alan Travis\u2019s story about the draft bill. New surveillance powers will be given to the police and security services, allowing them to access records tracking every UK citizen\u2019s use of the internet without any need for any judicial check, under the provisions of the draft investigatory powers bill unveiled on Wednesday lunchtime. It includes new powers requiring internet and phone companies to keep \u201cinternet connection records\u201d \u2013 tracking every website visited but not every page \u2013 for a maximum of 12 months but will not require a warrant for the police, security services or other bodies to access the data. Local authorities will be banned from accessing internet records. The proposed legislation will also introduce a \u201cdouble lock\u201d on the ministerial approval of interception warrants with a new panel of seven judicial commissioners \u2013 probably retired judges \u2013 given a veto before they can come into force. But the details of the bill make clear that this new safeguard for the most intrusive powers to spy on the content of people\u2019s conversations and messages will not apply in \u201curgent cases\u201d \u2013 defined as up to five days \u2013 where judicial approval is not possible. The draft investigatory powers bill published on Wednesday by the home secretary, Theresa May, aims to provide a \u201ccomprehensive and comprehensible\u2019 overhaul of Britain\u2019s fragmented surveillance laws. It comes two-and-a-half years after the disclosures by the whistleblower Edward Snowden of the scale of secret mass surveillance of the global traffic in confidential personal data carried out by Britain\u2019s GCHQ and the US\u2019s national security agency (NSA). It will replace the current system of three separate commissioners with a senior judge as a single investigatory powers commissioner. The draft bill explicitly includes in statute for the first time powers for the bulk collection of large volumes of communications and other personal data by MI5, GCHQ, MI6 and for their use of \u201cequipment interference powers\u201d \u2013 the ability to hack computers and phones around the world \u2013 for purposes of national security, serious crime and economic wellbeing.\nMay says the bill published today is not a return to the draft communications data bill of 2012 she says. It does not require the retention of third-party data. It does not oblige overseas firms to comply with domestic retention obligations. And it does not ban encryption, she says. She says it also accepts all the recommendations of the joint committee that looked at the 2012 bill. A joint committee will look at this draft bill. And a proper bill will be published in the spring, she says.\nTheresa May is speaking now. We live in a digital age, she says. Technology is having a profound effect, and digital offers many opportunities. But it also offers threats. In the last 12 months alone six significant threats have been detected in the UK. More companies are under cyber-attack. And it is estimated that there are 50,000 people downloading images of children.\nPMQs is over. Theresa May\u2019s statement is about to start. On the microphones Cameron can be heard saying PMQs is taking longer and longer.\nNigel Dodds, the DUP, asks about the loss of jobs from a closure of a factory in Northern Ireland, partly due to high energy costs. And will the prime minister reverse the thrust of the policy on tax credits? Cameron says firms deemed part of energy intensive industries do qualify for help. He says Northern Ireland has powers to set its own rate of corporation tax. He wants a stronger private sector there. On tax credits, he says the answer he gave to Corbyn applies; the plans will be announced three weeks today.\nAndrew Mitchell, a Conservative, says the mental health campaign is an all-party one. Cameron says more is being invested in mental health than ever before. Mental health should no longer be treated as a Cinderella service, he says.\nNorman Lamb, a Lib Dem, thanks Cameron for backing the campaign that he, Andrew Mitchell and Alastair Campbell are leading asking for equality for mental health. Will Cameron ensure the spending review delivers the extra funding necessary? Cameron praises Lamb for his work on this. There are now twice as many talking therapies as five years ago. But there is more to do, he says.\nSteve Double, a Conservative, asks about Newquay airport. Cameron says he is a huge fan of the airport, and a frequent user.\nLabour\u2019s Paul Flynn asks about the British servicemen and women who died in Iraq and Afghanistan. Will Cameron rethink his plans to join a four-sided civil war in Syria? On Armistice Day we should put aside political debates like this, says Cameron.\nJohn Nicolson, the SNP MP, asks Cameron to confirm he has no plans to sell Channel 4. Cameron says he is a huge fan of Channel 4. It was a great Conservative innovation. He wants to make sure it has a strong and secure future. He wants to look at all the options, including options for getting private investment into it. It would be wrong to \u201cclose our minds\u201d, he says. He wants it to have a great future. Cameron confirms that government considering plans to part-privatise Channel 4.\nKevin Hollinrake, a Conservative, asks Cameron to confirm that he is committed to the north. Cameron says the north needs a better deal on roads and rail. Some \u00a313bn is now being spent, he says.\nLabour\u2019s Diana Johnson asks about a case involving parents in her constituency whose child died and who were then not able to find out what happened to the ashes. Cameron says he will look into this.\nAnne-Marie Trevelyan, a Conservative, says there are 150 patients in Bucharest needing expert burns treatment following the nightclub fire. But they do not have enough beds there. Can the UK help? Cameron says this is a good suggestion. He will look into it.\nLabour\u2019s Gordon Marsden asks about the cuts to police funding. Cameron quotes a report saying Lancashire Police is exceptionally well placed to meet its police obligations.\nStephen Metcalfe, a Conservative, asks about apprenticeships and the skills gap. Will Cameron redouble his efforts to hit the 3m new apprenticeships target. Cameron says he will. Many firms find that many people apply for apprenticeships, but that too many of them do not have the right qualifications. He says Nadhim Zahawi will be his new adviser on apprenticeships.\nSnap PMQs verdict: A scrappy, inconclusive PMQs. Cameron mocked Corbyn for returning to the tax credit question that worked so well for him last week, but there can be merit in persistence and, although Cameron had better answers than he did last week, Corbyn made his point effectively. Corbyn was probably less successful with his final three questions on the NHS, but Cameron\u2019s attempts to shift the subject were not edifying either, and neither side can claim a win. But the high-minded, policy-focused tone seems to be slipping. This sounded very like an old-fashioned, Cameron/Miliband PMQs, and Cameron can no longer hide the scorn he clearly feels for Corbyn. But letting it show is not necessarily a good idea.\nCorbyn says the prime minister did not reply to his point about the winter crisis. John Bercow intervenes to stop the shouting, which seems particularly loud. Corbyn says, if Cameron won\u2019t answer his question, then perhaps he will address a point from the Kings Fund. It said the NHS was facing an inevitable decline in patient care unless something was done. Which is rising faster? NHS waiting lists or NHS deficits? Cameron says Simon Stevens, the NHS England chief executive, asked for \u00a38m extra in funding. The government has offered \u00a310bn. The number of treatments are going up. If you want to know what is in crisis, it is Labour. Corbyn\u2019s media adviser is a Stalinist, and his policy adviser is a Communist, he says. Corbyn says if Cameron\u2019s party cannot match its actions with its words, it should get rid of him. The NHS is in crisis. Will Cameron ensure everyone can rely on it. It is the jewel in everyone\u2019s crown. Cameron says, since he became prime minister, the number of doctors has gone up by more than 10,000, and the number of nurses up by more than 5,000. The UK is able to fund the NHS. But the countries Corbyn admires, with crazy socialist plans, have to cut their health service, he says.\nCorbyn says the prime minister makes choices. A private in the army would lose over \u00a32,000 next April. Surely the whole point of parliament is to put questions to those in authority. He asks a question from Kieron, a veteran of the first Gulf War. Is this how the government treats veterans? Cameron says many soldiers will benefit from the \u00a311,000 personal allowance coming in next year. Soldiers with children will benefit from the free childcare announcements. And he will see the full plans in three weeks time. That serving soldier is now dealing with an opposition leader who said he could see no point in the armed forces. (Cameron is quoting Corbyn out of context here.) Corbyn turns to junior doctors\u2019 pay. He quotes a doctor saying this winter will be worse than last winter. Can Cameron guarantee there will be no winter crisis this year. Cameron says the Royal College of Emergency Medicine supports what the government is doing. He urges doctors to go on the NHS website and see what their pay will be. No one will lose out. The NHS has the resources that it needs. It is a much stronger NHS, because we have a strong economy.\nJeremy Corbyn says he concurs with the prime minsiter\u2019s remarks about Remembrance Sunday. We should all try to build a peaceful world. Last week he asked the same question six times. Cameron has now had a week to think about it, so he will ask again. Can he guarantee no one will be worse off from the tax credit changes. Cameron says he can guarantee that there will be a tax allowance that saves people money, and that there will be a national living wage of \u00a37.20. As for the tax credit changes, he will answer details about them when they are announced. If Corbyn wants to ask the same question, that will be very entertaining. Corbyn says this is not about entertainment. It is not funny for those affected. What abut this question from a Tory MP who said any mitigation should be full mitigation. What is his answer to that? Very much the same answer, says Cameron. The government will announce its plans to move to a low tax, high pay economy then. But, if we don\u2019t reform welfare, how will we fund the police service, or the health service, or defence? If we listened to Corbyn, we would still have families in London getting \u00a3100,000 in housing benefit.\nCraig Tracey, a Conservative, says he is looking forward to his Armistice Day parade. Does Cameron agree it is important to maintain the 2% of GDP defence spending commitment. Cameron does agree. The defence spending commitment, and the 0.7% aid one, and Trident are all important, he says.\nDavid Cameron says this is the last PMQs before Armistice Day. He wants to pay tribute to those who gave their lives for their country.\n\nPMQs is about to start. Here is a preview of one question coming up.\nPMQs starts in just under 15 minutes. Labour has just put out a statement from Jeremy Corbyn criticising the government\u2019s decision to invite the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, to London. Corbyn said: David Cameron\u2019s invitation to Britain today of the Egyptian president and coup leader Abdel Fatah al-Sisi shows contempt for human and democratic rights and threatens, rather than protects, Britain\u2019s national security. Support for dialogue and negotiated conflict resolution in the Middle East is vital to us all. But to welcome and bolster with military support the coup leader who overthrew a democratically elected president in 2013 and has presided over the killing and jailing of many thousands since makes a mockery of government claims to be promoting peace and justice in the region. Support for dictatorial regimes in the Middle East has been a key factor fuelling the spread of terrorism. Rather than rolling out the red carpet to President Sisi, the prime minister should suspend arms exports to Egypt until democratic and civil rights are restored.\nHave some thought for the journalists who will have to make sense of the draft investigatory powers bill quickly. This is from the BBC\u2019s Gordon Corera.\nJulian Huppert, the former Lib Dem MP, agrees with Henry Porter (see 11.12am) that who sits on the committee scrutinising the bill will be crucial.\nHenry Porter, the journalist and privacy campaigner, says there are rumours that Paul Murphy, the former Northern Ireland secretary, may chair a joint committee being set up to scrutinise the draft investigatory powers bill. Murphy is a former chair of the intelligence and security committee, and would be seen as sympathetic to the concerns of the security services.\nFor more background, here\u2019s a internet surveillance reading list. The Guardian story about the draft communications data bill in 2012. And here is the bill itself (pdf). The report from a joint committee of MPs and peers set up to consider the draft communications data bill (pdf). The report, which was published in December 2012, was very critical, saying the draft bill went too far. Here\u2019s an excerpt. We accept that there is a case for legislation which will provide the law enforcement agencies with some further access to communications data, but we believe that the draft bill pays insufficient attention to the duty to respect the right to privacy, and goes much further than it need or should for the purpose of providing necessary and justifiable official access to communications data. Clause 1 would give the secretary of state sweeping powers to issue secret notices to communications service providers (CSPs) requiring them to retain and disclose potentially limitless categories of data. We have been told that she has no intention of using the powers in this way. Our main recommendation is therefore that her powers should be limited to those categories of data for which a case can now be made. If in future a case can be made for the power to be increased, this should not be done without effective parliamentary scrutiny. We recommend the procedure for this. A report from the intelligence and security committee in March this year calling for an overhaul of surveillance laws. Here is the report (pdf) and here is the news release (pdf). The report from David Anderson, the government\u2019s independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, in June this year called A Question of Trust. This 373-page report set out detailed proposals for a new bill. Here is the press release about it (pdf), here is the report (pdf), and here is the Guardian story about its publication. And here is a Martin Kettle column praising it. This is how it starts: Occasionally in the long history of British policymaking someone manages to break through the confusion and reset the terms of an apparently unresolvable public argument. Edwin Chadwick on the poor law and public health, William Beveridge on the welfare system and Leslie Scarman on the police all changed things for generations \u2013 and for the public good \u2013 in their respective fields. The question today is whether the name of David Anderson \u2013 Britain\u2019s watchdog on terrorism laws \u2013 should be added to the list of these national reformer-reconcilers. With a fair wind behind it, his report on the future of surveillance laws, published yesterday, may eventually prove to have poured calming oils on a stormy argument that British governments have often seemed incapable of resolving. If Anderson\u2019s plea is taken seriously, and we wipe the slate clean and start again on Britain\u2019s efforts to balance security and privacy in the pursuit of crime in the borderless online world, his report really could be the turning point that policymakers have looked for and missed ever since 9/11. A 28-page briefing paper from the House of Commons library about the background to the publication of the draft investigatory powers bill (pdf).\nOn the Today programme morning Sara Thornton, chair of the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council, used an interview to explain why the police wanted internet surveillance laws to be updated. Law enforcement needs access to communications data to protect the public and to investigate crime. We use communications data in day to day investigations. This is about what ordinary detectives do; they make the vast majority of applications for communciations data. The bottom line is we are just not keeping up with technology. Five or six years ago it used to be about phone records; just about who\u2019s calling who and where, not about the content at all. Of course, more and more of us are using the internet for those communications now. And therefore we need to have those internet communications records to find out what communication platforms people are using. She also insisted that the police were not interested in looking about people\u2019s website browsing histories. Can I just say, it is categorically not the case that we want to see people\u2019s internet browsing histories. It is not about that. It is about what communications platforms people are using, such as Facebook or WhatsApp. I\u2019ll give you a good example. You might remember Operation [Voicer?], a case of a paedophile ring who were jailed earlier this year. They had been filming the abuse of babies and toddlers and they had been streaming it on the internet. The gang are all in prison. But we know that over 260 people viewed that abuse online. We\u2019ve identified quite a lot of them. But 38 we are still unable to identify. Now, if we had access to internet connection records, we would be able to find their IP addresses, their internet protocol addresses, and find them. We are not able to do that at the moment.\nSeveral of the papers have stories previewing today\u2019s draft investigatory powers bill, but only two of them have splashed on it. In the Times (paywall) Sean O\u2019Neill says Theresa May will give judges the power to veto ministers\u2019 decisions about interception warrants. A handful of judges will get the power to veto ministers\u2019 decisions on all top-level antiterrorism spying operations under proposals being put forward by the home secretary today. The panel of specially trained judges \u2014 expected to number at least ten \u2014 should review thousands of national security warrants each year and hold the intelligence agencies to account, according to draft surveillance laws to be presented to parliament. The move represents a significant concession by ministers to the privacy lobby\u2019s demand for greater scrutiny of spy agencies after the Edward Snowden leaks scandal. It is contained in the draft Investigatory Powers Bill, which aims to set out in more detail than ever before the state\u2019s powers to spy on citizens, alongside a new range of safeguards for individuals.\nAnd in the Daily Telegraph Tom Whitehead says the draft bill will allow council officials to be jailed if they misuse snooping powers. (The Daily Mail focuses on the same line in its preview story.) The Telegraph reports: Town hall officials will face up to two years in prison if they abuse snooping powers under a crackdown on council surveillance to be unveiled on Wednesday. A new offence is to be created to target public authorities who inappropriately access phone and email records. Local authorities will also be banned from accessing the web histories of members of the public when ministers publish the biggest overhaul of spying laws for 15 years. The measures will be included in the Investigatory Powers Bill which includes a raft of proposals to expand the ability of the police and spy agencies to monitor suspects.\nThere is a lot of jargon in internet surveillance legislation that is hard to follow. The BBC has a handy guide translating some of the more difficult terms at the end of this Q&A.\nThere are few issues more fundamental in a liberal democracy than privacy and surveillance, and what powers we decide to give the state to allow it to monitor our communications. But none of this is easy or straightforward. A report earlier this year described one of the key Act\u2019s governing this area as \u201cobscure since its inception\u201d and \u201cincomprehensible to all but a tiny band of initiates\u201d. Today Theresa May, the home secretary, is announcing plans for a major overhaul of the legislation governing internet surveillance. We\u2019ll be trying to ensure that what she proposes is fully comprehensible, and not just to \u201cinitiates\u201d. May\u2019s announcement is the culmination of a process lasting more than three years. I will post more on the background later, but here are the key milestones. In June 2012 the coalition government published a draft communications data bill. This was published because the Home Office believed that changing technology meant it needed to update surveillance laws, but it included plans to monitor internet use, critics dubbed it the \u201csnoopers\u2019 charter\u201d, the Lib Dems said they would never approve it and it was shelved. The legislation never came to parliament. In June 2013 the Guardian started publishing stories based on leaked information from Edward Snowden revealing the full extent of internet surveillance carried out by the National Security Agency in America and GCHQ in the UK. The revelations triggered a worldwide debate about privacy and security (although the debate was much more muted in the UK than it was in America and continental Europe, where lawmakers seemed to take privacy concerns more seriously.) This year, following the election of a majority Conservative government, David Cameron and May promised to bring the communications data bill back in a revised form. The result is the investigatory powers bill being published this afternoon. My colleague Alan Travis has written a preview of what we will get. Here is his story, and here is how it starts. Theresa May is to propose a major extension of the surveillance state when she publishes legislation requiring internet companies to store details of every website visited by customers over the previous year. The home secretary will try to sweeten the pill of her revived snooper\u2019s charter on Wednesday by announcing that the police will need to get judicial authorisation before they can access the internet connection records of an individual \u2013 something that is currently banned in the US and every European country, including Britain. She will also try to strengthen the oversight of Britain\u2019s surveillance by replacing the current fragmented system of three separate commissioners with an investigatory powers commissioner who will be a senior judge appointed by the prime minister on the recommendation of the lord chief justice. I will mostly be focusing on the investigatory powers bill today, although I will also be covering PMQs. Here are the timings. 12pm: David Cameron faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. 12.30pm: Theresa May makes a statement to MPs about the investigatory powers bill. The full bill is published simultaneously by the Home Office.

Waller, who is the intelligence services commissioner, has refused to appear before the Commons home affairs select committee in a rare clash over the parliamentary accountability of Britain's intelligence agencies. The summons was issued at midday on Thursday and is a rare move by a parliamentary committee which has the power to send for people and papers. The order to appear on 18 March was approved without a vote on the committee. Waller is one of two former senior judges charged with the oversight of the security services, including MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, which have been at the centre of disclosures over the US National Security Agency's mass digital surveillance programmes. The other retired judge, Sir Anthony May, is responsible specifically for oversight of the interception capabilities of the security services. He told the committee earlier that the 570,000 requests a year for communications data by public authorities was \"possibly too large\". Keith Vaz, the chairman of the committee, said: \"The intelligence services commissioner plays a vital role in keeping under review the way in which the home secretary and the intelligence services use the powers which they have been granted by parliament. This function was conferred on the commissioner by act of parliament, and Sir Mark must be accountable to parliament for the way in which he carries them out. \"Both the information commissioner and the interception of communications commissioner have accepted invitations to give evidence to the committee in the last few weeks. We do not see why the intelligence services commissioner should be any different and the committee was disappointed by his refusal to attend. \"Sir Mark has referred us to his published report. While the information in this report is useful to the committee, effective parliamentary scrutiny requires the opportunity to ask questions and receive full answers. \"We have therefore taken the unusual step of summoning Sir Mark. This happens only very rarely, where an essential witness declines to appear in response to an invitation. Indeed, it is the only time that this committee has summoned a witness in this parliament,\" he said. The clash comes a fortnight after the Labour leader, Ed Miliband, called for a major overhaul of the oversight of Britain's intelligence services, including reform of the commissioners' roles as part of his campaign against \"unaccountable power\".\n", "title": "MPs summon security services watchdog over Snowden leaks"}, {"date": "2015-03-18T09:38:10Z", "body": "Now here\u2019s a debate on a hot topic that no reporter, or student reporter, should miss: \u201cJournalists, surveillance and the police: how can the secret state learn to live with the fourth estate?\u201d It\u2019s a panel discussion due to take place on 30 March at City University London, and it looks likely to be a humdinger. On the panel will be Sir David Omand, the former UK security and intelligence coordinator and an ex-director of GCHQ; Andy Trotter, former chief constable of British Transport Police who used to be the media lead for the Association of Chief Police Officers; Alan Rusbridger, editor-in-chief of Guardian News & Media and co-winner of the Pulitzer prize for publishing the Snowden leaks; and Michelle Stanistreet, general secretary of the National Union of Journalists. The speakers will consider the relationship between journalists who exercise their right to press freedom and the forces of the state who exercise their power to engage in mass surveillance. It is a debate that is bound to raise any number of questions. Was the Guardian right to publish the NSA files leaked by Edward Snowden? Are the secret services right to monitor our phone calls and emails? Why do the police think they should have a right to access journalists\u2019 private phone information under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa) without judicial authority? Is such surveillance fair and just? Overall, just what legal protections should be in place to protect confidential journalistic sources from state surveillance?

The Patriot Act provision, known as Section 215, permits intelligence and law enforcement agencies to acquire from a service provider records of someone\u2019s communications \u2013 such as phone calls or email records \u2013 that are relevant to a terrorism or espionage investigation. In June 2013, the Guardian, based on Snowden\u2019s leaks, revealed that the Bush and Obama administrations had secretly been using Section 215 to acquire Americans\u2019 phone data in bulk. The revelation led Congress to significantly curtail domestic bulk phone records collection in 2015. The new report from the justice department inspector general reveals that around 2009, the FBI began encountering resistance from email providers and others to a highly controversial nonjudicial subpoena for records, known as a National Security Letter. In the wake of this, the FBI began acquiring the information it sought through warrant requests to the Fisa court, a secret surveillance panel, using Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which the inspector general notes is a slower process. \u201cTransactional records for email,\u201d says the heavily redacted report, were \u201cthe most common type of records requested\u201d outside of bulk data collection, which the inspector general set aside. The shift resulted in an \u201cexponentially\u201d increasing FBI appetite for email and other records under the Patriot Act provision. In 2009, the Fisa court approved 21 such requests. By 2012, it had approved 212. A single order can encompass many people\u2019s records.\nBetween 2012 and 2014, the Fisa court issued 564 such orders, which the inspector general called \u201ca dramatic increase\u201d. Between 2007 and 2009, the court issued only 51 orders for domestic email and internet metadata, according to the previous inspector general\u2019s report on Section 215 issued last year. The Fisa court, the inspector general has now found, \u201cdid not deny any business records applications\u201d made between 2012 and 2014. But Snowden\u2019s revelations, beginning in mid-2013, helped shift the FBI away from using Section 215 to acquire email and other metadata. The Fisa court approved warrants to collect non-bulk business records 179 times in 2013, a number falling to 142 times in 2015 \u2013 though this was still a vast increase on the 21 approved in 2009. A senior national security official with the justice department told the inspector general that a \u201cstigma\u201d had been created around the Patriot Act provision, even outside of the bulk collection that privacy advocates rallied to stop. \u201cI think it\u2019s possible that folks \u2026 have decided it\u2019s not worth pursuing [business records orders], you know, obviously things haven\u2019t been great since Snowden either,\u201d the report quoted the unnamed official as saying. The justice department disputed Snowden\u2019s impact on the shift as \u201cspeculative\u201d and indicated that the data collection did not stop, so much as shifted legal justifications. Just as the 2009-era resistance to National Security Letters spurred the bureau to rely on Section 215 and the Fisa court for email and other records acquisition, the justice department\u2019s national security division told the inspector general that the FBI now uses a different authority, known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, for its email collection. Section 702, passed in 2008, permits the US government to collect large amounts of Americans\u2019 international communications, provided that no \u201cUS person\u201d within the country is an explicit target of the surveillance dragnet. The Fisa court reviews procedures for the collection but not the actual collection itself.\nBarack Obama voted in favor of the measure, which became a wellspring for the NSA\u2019s Prism program and its \u201cupstream\u201d siphoning of data transiting across the internet\u2019s fiberoptic backbone, while Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton voted against it. Civil libertarian groups contend that Section 702 is unconstitutionally broad. The authority is set to expire in 2017 unless it is renewed by Congress. The justice department did not release many specific numbers documenting the scope of the surveillance under Section 215. Charts explaining changes to the FBI\u2019s data collection patterns were blacked out of the public version of the inspector general\u2019s report. In 2013, after Snowden\u2019s revelations began, numerous FBI, National Security Agency and other US officials claimed Section 215 was vital for the prevention of domestic terrorism, a claim they subsequently walked back for lack of evidence.

Other prominent US whistleblowers also gave Snowden credit and argued that the curbs in the NSA\u2019s surveillance powers by Congress \u2013 combined with a federal court ruling last month that bulk phone record collection is illegal \u2013 should open the way for him to be allowed to return to the US, although they conceded this was unlikely. Ellsberg, the former US military analyst who risked jail in 1971 by leaking Pentagon papers showing the White House lied about the Vietnam war, welcomed the concessions made by the Senate, limited as they are. Sweeping US surveillance powers used by the NSA expired at midnight after a dramatic showdown in the Senate. Some are likely to be replaced with those in new legislation, the USA Freedom Act.\n\u201cIt is just one step on the road to regaining our rights. It is a promising beginning and we have Snowden to thank for that,\u201d Ellsberg told the Guardian. He described the Patriot Act, which was used by the NSA as authorisation for the bulk phone data collection, as a monstrosity. Ellsberg was, like Snowden many years later, accused under the Espionage Act over the 1971 leaks, but the case against him was dismissed. He was in London at the start of a weeklong speaking tour with other American whistleblowers, including Thomas Drake, a former NSA member who revealed widespread abuses and violations; Jesselyn Radack, a former justice department official; and Coleen Rowley, a former FBI special agent who challenged supposed evidence used to justify the Iraq invasion. Their tour takes in Oslo, Stockholm and Berlin and is aimed at encouraging \u201ca culture of openness and truth as well as security for those who take the risk of disclosing information that authorities want to keep hidden\u201d. Ellsberg has been nominated for this year\u2019s Nobel peace prize. Asked about the importance of the recent events in Congress, Ellsberg said: \u201cThis is the first time, thanks to Snowden, that the Senate really stood up and realised they have been complicit in the violation of our rights all along \u2013 unconstitutional action. The Senate and the House have been passive up until now and derelict in their responsibilities. At last there was opposition.\u201d What should happen to Snowden? \u201cHe should get the Nobel peace prize and he should get asylum in a west European country,\u201d Ellsberg said. \u201cI do not think he will ever be able to come back to the United States no matter how popular he might come to be, and I think there is much more support for him month by month as people come to realise how little substance in the charges that he caused harm to us. They realise he is responsible for the debate going on. \u201cBut that does not mean the intelligence community will ever forgive him for having exposed what they were doing. I don\u2019t think any president will find it politic to confront the intelligence community by pardoning him or allowing him to come back.\u201d Others have been less forthright. Asked whether the rejection of bulk collection by Congress and the courts meant it was now time to review official US attitudes to Snowden, Rand Paul, the Republican presidential candidate who played a key role in ensuring the Patriot Act provisions expired on Sunday night, declined to comment. \u201cI don\u2019t have any control over that,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThat, I think, is going to be up to the president, and that\u2019s a president who used to be against the Patriot Act, so someone should ask him why he changed his mind,\u201d he added. Republican senator Dean Heller gave Snowden some credit for kickstarting the debate. \u201cNo doubt it played a role,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cI think it played the same role for me as it did for most of the American people, who were surprised and stunned that the government had this sort of access to this kind of data.\u201d Radack described the events in the Senate on Sunday as \u201ca hugely symbolic moment\u201d, noting that it was the first time that the powers in the Patriot Act had not been automatically re-authorised annually. Drake challenged the need for mass surveillance rather than targeted surveillance. \u201cAre there legitimate threats? Yes.

This came to pass, and his skeleton now sits in a glass case at University College London, adorned with a wax head, waistcoat and jacket and sat on a wooden stool, staring out at students from its glass case. Bentham was regarded as the founder of utilitarianism and a leading advocate of the separation of church and state, freedom of expression and individual legal rights. And now, from beyond the grave, his cadaver contains a webcam that records the movements of its spectators and broadcasts them live online, part of UCL\u2019s PanoptiCam project which tests, amonst other things, surveillance algorithms. As I write this, a young couple are walking across the corridor, his hand pressed against the small of her back. Prof Melissa Terras, director of the UCL Centre for Digital Humanities, tells me that the camera is used to learn the best way \u201cto identify and count different people in still images, accurately.\u201d UCL are hoping that it will spark discussion around contemporary surveillance, but it isn\u2019t a coincidence that this webcam is attached to Bentham\u2019s box. The PanoptiCam project is a pun on the \u201cpanopticon\u201d, a type of institutional building that has long dominated Bentham\u2019s legacy. The Panopticon legacy As a work of architecture, the panopticon allows a watchman to observe occupants without the occupants knowing whether or not they are being watched. As a metaphor, the panopticon was commandeered in the latter half of the 20th century as a way to trace the surveillance tendencies of disciplinarian societies. Is it still a useful way to think about surveillance in an age of NSA and GCHQ? The basic setup of Bentham\u2019s panopticon is this: there is a central tower surrounded by cells. In the central tower is the watchman. In the cells are prisoners \u2013 or workers, or children, depending on the use of the building. The tower shines bright light so that the watchman is able to see everyone in the cells. The people in the cells, however, aren\u2019t able to see the watchman, and therefore have to assume that they are always under observation. \u201cThe panopticon wasn\u2019t originally Bentham\u2019s idea. It was his brother\u2019s,\u201d says Philip Schofield, professor of the History of Legal and Political Thought and Director of the Bentham Project at UCL. \u201cHis brother Samuel was working in Russia on the estate in Krichev and he had a relatively unskilled workforce, so he sat himself in the middle of this factory and arranged his workforce in a circle around his central desk so he could keep an eye on what everyone was doing.\u201d Bentham went to visit his brother in the late 1780s, saw what he was doing, and decided the centralised arrangement could be applied to all sorts of different situations - not just prisons but factories, schools and hospitals. Bentham managed to persuade the prime minister, William Pitt the Younger, to fund a panopticon National Penitentiary, but a stream of problems eventually meant the project was abandoned. Bentham never saw a panopticon built during his lifetime. A number of prisons have since incorporated panopticon elements into their design but it wasn\u2019t until the 1920s that the closest thing to a panopticon prison was built \u2013 the Presidio Modelo complex in Cuba, infamous for corruption and cruelty, now abandoned.\n\u2018The principle is central inspection\u2019 The French philosopher Michel Foucault revitalised interest in the panopticon in his 1975 book Discipline and Punish. Foucault used the panopticon as a way to illustrate the proclivity of disciplinary societies subjugate its citizens. He describes the prisoner of a panopticon as being at the receiving end of asymmetrical surveillance: \u201cHe is seen, but he does not see; he is an object of information, never a subject in communication.\u201d As a consequence, the inmate polices himself for fear of punishment. \u201cThe principle is central inspection,\u201d Schofield tells me. \u201cYou can do central inspection by CCTV. You don\u2019t need a round building to do it. Monitoring electronic communications from a central location, that is panoptic. The real heart of Bentham\u2019s panoptic idea is that there are certain activities which are better conducted when they are supervised.\u201d In many ways, the watchtower at the heart of the panopticon is a precursor to the cameras fastened to our buildings \u2013 purposely visible machines with human eyes hidden from view. The parallels between the panopticon and CCTV may be obvious, but what happens when you step into the world of digital surveillance and data capture? Are we still \u201cobjects of information\u201d as we swipe between cells on our smartphone screens? Unlike the Panopticon, citizens don\u2019t know they are being watched Jake Goldenfein, researcher at the Centre for Media and Communications Law, University of Melbourne, tells me it\u2019s important to remember the corrective purposes of Bentham\u2019s panopticon when considering it as a metaphor for modern surveillance. \u201cThe relevance of the panopticon as a metaphor begins to wither when we start thinking about whether contemporary types of visuality (effectively digital and data-driven) are analogous to the central tower concept. For example, whether this type of visuality is as asymmetrical, and \u2013 I think more importantly \u2013 being co-opted for the same political exercise. Does the fact that we don\u2019t know we\u2019re being watched mean we are being normalised in the way the panopticon was intended to correct behaviour?\u201d\nAs Goldenfein suggests, the asymmetrical exposure of inmates in Bentham\u2019s building is of a different order to how government bodies such as GCHQ conduct surveillance. In the panopticon the occupants are constantly aware of the threat of being watched \u2013 this is the whole point \u2013 but state surveillance on the internet is invisible; there is no looming tower, no dead-eye lens staring at you every time you enter a URL. It wasn\u2019t until the Snowden leaks that the scale of NSA and GCHQ operations became known. This arguably makes the system more panoptic post-Snowden, when we are aware of it, but it hasn\u2019t been the official rhetoric. The original emphasis, and still the emphasis today, hasn\u2019t been on correcting behaviour but on providing security, namely from terrorists. Another important difference is the relative intangibility of data surveillance. With Bentham\u2019s panopticon, and to some extent CCTV, there is a physical sense of exposure in the face of authority. In the private space of my personal browsing I do not feel exposed \u2013 I do not feel that my body of data is under surveillance because I do not know where that body begins or ends. We live so much of our lives online, share so much data, but feel nowhere near as much attachment for our data as we do for our bodies. Without physical ownership and without an explicit sense of exposure I do not normalise my actions. If anything, the supposed anonymity of the internet means I do the opposite. My data, however, is under surveillance, not only by my government but also by corporations that make enormous amounts of money capitalising on it. Not only that, but the amount of data on offer to governments and corporations is about to go through the roof, and as it does the panopticon may emerge as a model once more. Why? Because our bodies are about to be brought back into the mix.\nInternet of things: morals reformed? Health preserved? Industry invigorated? The looming interconnectivity between objects in our homes, cars and cities, generally referred to as the internet of things, will change digital surveillance substantially. With the advent of wider networked systems, heralded by the likes of Google\u2019s Brillo and Apple\u2019s HomeKit, everything from washing machines to sex toys will soon be able to communicate, creating a vast amount of data about our lives. And this deluge of data won\u2019t only be passed back and forth between objects but will most likely wind its way towards corporate and government reservoirs. With everything from heart-rate monitors in smartwatches to GPS footwear, a bright light is once again being thrown on our bodies. Will we feel exposed under the gaze of a central tower? Perhaps not, but with habits and physical stats charted against the norm, we will feel scrutinised nevertheless. Much of the justification of this is the alleged benefits to health and wellbeing. \u201cMorals reformed \u2013 health preserved \u2013 industry invigorated\u201d \u2013 not Apple marketing material but Bentham\u2019s words on the panopticon. There may not be a central tower, but there will be communicating sensors in our most intimate objects. Bentham didn\u2019t want the panopticon to be a tool for oppression, and in fact its failure eventually led him to develop a type of anti-panopticon later in life \u2013 where a minister sits in an exposed room and is surrounded by members of the public who listen and ask questions. The idea is that this transparency holds power to account, because the most dangerous people in society can be rulers. It is important that they, as well as prisoners, workers and children, feel watched. It is difficult not to think of that audience chamber when you stare at Bentham in his box, a skeleton on a stool, an object of information posed for all to see.\n", "title": "What does the panopticon mean in the age of digital surveillance?"}, {"date": "2015-02-06T13:24:15Z", "body": "Reaction by privacy campaigners and others to Friday\u2019s landmark ruling that GCHQ\u2019s mass surveillance was unlawful contrasts sharply with that of the intelligence agency itself.\nWhile a GCHQ spokesperson insisted the ruling by Britain\u2019s Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) found against the authorities only \u201cin one small respect\u201d, Privacy International said the decision had \u201cvindicated\u201d the actions of Edward Snowden, the former US National Security Agency (NSA) whistleblower whose revelations led to the IPT investigation. Downing Street said the judgment \u2013 which found that GCHQ\u2019s access to intercepted information obtained by the NSA breached human rights law until the end of last year \u2013 did not require GCHQ to change its operations. GCHQ spokesperson We are pleased that the court has once again ruled that the UK\u2019s bulk interception regime is fully lawful. It follows the court\u2019s clear rejection of accusations of \u2018mass surveillance\u2019 in their December judgment. The IPT has, however, found against the government in one small respect in relation to the historic intelligence-sharing legal regime. The court has ruled that the public disclosure of two paragraphs of additional detail, voluntarily disclosed by the government during the litigation, were essential to make the public regime sufficiently foreseeable and therefore fully compatible with the European convention on human rights. They found that to the extent that these two paragraphs were not previously in the public domain, the intelligence-sharing regime prior to that point was in contravention of human rights law. But the judgment does not in any way suggest that important safeguards protecting privacy were not in place at all relevant times. It does not require GCHQ to change what it does to protect national security in any way. Today\u2019s IPT ruling reaffirms that the processes and safeguards within the intelligence-sharing regime were fully adequate at all times \u2013 it is simply about the amount of detail about those processes and safeguards that needed to be in the public domain. We welcome the important role the IPT has played in ensuring that the public regime is sufficiently detailed. By its nature, much of GCHQ\u2019s work must remain secret. But we are working with the rest of government to improve public understanding about what we do and the strong legal and policy framework that underpins all our work. We continue to do what we can to place information safely into the public domain that can help to achieve this. James Welch, legal director for Liberty We now know that, by keeping the public in the dark about their secret dealings with the NSA, GCHQ acted unlawfully and violated our rights. That their activities are now deemed lawful is thanks only to the degree of disclosure Liberty and the other claimants were able to force from our secrecy-obsessed government. But the intelligence services retain a largely unfettered power to rifle through millions of people\u2019s private communications \u2013 and the tribunal believes the limited safeguards revealed during last year\u2019s legal proceedings are an adequate protection of our privacy. We disagree, and will be taking our fight to the European court of human rights. Eric King, deputy director of Privacy International For far too long, intelligence agencies like GCHQ and NSA have acted like they are above the law. Today\u2019s decision confirms to the public what many have said all along: over the past decade, GCHQ and the NSA have been engaged in an illegal mass surveillance sharing programme that has affected millions of people around the world. We must not allow agencies to continue justifying mass surveillance programmes using secret interpretations of secret laws. The world owes Edward Snowden a great debt for blowing the whistle, and today\u2019s decision is a vindication of his actions. But more work needs to be done. The only reason why the NSA-GCHQ sharing relationship is still legal today is because of a last-minute clean-up effort by government to release previously secret \u201carrangements\u201d. That is plainly not enough to fix what remains a massive loophole in the law, and we hope that the European court decides to rule in favour of privacy rather than unchecked state power. Elizabeth Knight, legal director at Open Rights Group This ruling is a very welcome first step. It shows that secret policies are not an acceptable basis for highly intrusive intelligence sharing practices. However, the IPT has not gone far enough. These flimsy policies are not enough to comply with the requirements of human rights law, even now they are public. And GCHQ\u2019s own Tempora programme of mass interception is clearly both unlawful and disproportionate. We hope the European court of human rights will go further than the IPT and find that mass surveillance breaches our human right to privacy. Cori Crider, director, Reprieve After a decade and a half of siding with the government, it is welcome that the IPT is beginning to hold our spies to account. But stark problems with the UK\u2019s surveillance system remain: for years the government has written itself a blank cheque to eavesdrop on confidential communications between lawyers and clients, even in cases where the government itself is in the dock. This is totally unfair and undermines the core premise of our legal system. Downing Street spokeswoman The overall judgment this morning is that the UK\u2019s interception regime is fully lawful. That follows on from the court\u2019s clear rejection of accusations of mass surveillance in their December judgment, and we welcome that. It\u2019s important to be clear that the overall interception regime and bulk interception they found fully, fully lawful, and that it was compliant with the right to privacy at all times. What they said was, on the legal framework governing that, that there should be more about the rules that should be disclosed publicly. I think it was two paragraphs of additional detail, and the government did that during the proceedings. They are not questioning in this judgment that the safeguarding of privacy was in any way jeopardised and the judgment will not require GCHQ to change what it does. The spokeswoman added that the prime minister believes the government should make sure the intelligence agencies \u201ccontinue to have the powers they need to keep us safe\u201d. On Twitter, the longer term consequences of the ruling were seized upon.

A panel of three federal judges for the second circuit overturned an earlier ruling that the controversial surveillance practice first revealed to the US public by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden in 2013 could not be subject to judicial review.\nBut the judges also waded into the charged and ongoing debate over the reauthorization of a key Patriot Act provision currently before US legislators. That provision, which the appeals court ruled the NSA program surpassed, will expire on 1 June amid gridlock in Washington on what to do about it. The judges opted not to end the domestic bulk collection while Congress decides its fate, calling judicial inaction \u201ca lesser intrusion\u201d on privacy than at the time the case was initially argued. \u201cIn light of the asserted national security interests at stake, we deem it prudent to pause to allow an opportunity for debate in Congress that may (or may not) profoundly alter the legal landscape,\u201d the judges ruled. But they also sent a tacit warning to Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate who is pushing to re-authorize the provision, known as Section 215, without modification: \u201cThere will be time then to address appellants\u2019 constitutional issues.\u201d \u201cWe hold that the text of section 215 cannot bear the weight the government asks us to assign to it, and that it does not authorize the telephone metadata program,\u201d concluded their judgment. \u201cSuch a monumental shift in our approach to combating terrorism requires a clearer signal from Congress than a recycling of oft\u2010used language long held in similar contexts to mean something far narrower,\u201d the judges added. \u201cWe conclude that to allow the government to collect phone records only because they may become relevant to a possible authorized investigation in the future fails even the permissive \u2018relevance\u2019 test. \u201cWe agree with appellants that the government\u2019s argument is \u2018irreconcilable with the statute\u2019s plain text\u2019.\u201d\nThe ruling, one of several in federal courts since the Guardian exposed the domestic bulk collection thanks to Snowden, immediately took on political freight. Senator Rand Paul, a Republican presidential candidate who has made opposition to over-broad surveillance central to his platform, tweeted: \u201cThe phone records of law abiding citizens are none of the NSA\u2019s business! Pleased with the ruling this morning.\u201d The White House stressed that it too supported an overhaul of the program, though declined to comment on the blow to the NSA\u2019s existing legal authority. \u201cWe are in the process of evaluating the decision handed down this morning,\u201d assistant press secretary Ned Price told the Guardian. \u201cWithout commenting on the ruling today, the president has been clear that he believes we should end the Section 215 bulk telephony metadata program as it currently exists by creating an alternative mechanism to preserve the program\u2019s essential capabilities without the government holding the bulk data. \u201cWe continue to work closely with members of Congress from both parties to do just that, and we have been encouraged by good progress on bipartisan, bicameral legislation that would implement these important reforms,\u201d added Price. But opponents in Congress were emphatic that the ruling represented a breakthrough in their fight to rein in executive overreach on surveillance. \u201cToday\u2019s court decision reaffirms what I\u2019ve been saying since the Snowden leaks came to light. Congress never intended Section 215 to allow bulk collection,\u201d said Republican Jim Sensenbrenner. \u201cThis program is illegal and based on a blatant misinterpretation of the law. It\u2019s time for Congress to pass the USA Freedom Act in order to protect both civil liberties and national security with legally authorized surveillance.\u201d \u201cThis is a huge step for individual Americans\u2019 rights,\u201d added leading Senate critic Ron Wyden. \u201cNow that this program is finally being examined in the sunlight, the executive branch\u2019s claims about its legality and effectiveness are crumbling. The president should end mass surveillance immediately. If not, Congress needs to finish the job and finally end this dragnet.\u201d\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, which led the initial legal challenge against director of national intelligence James Clapper, predicted that its victory on Thursday should force Congress to take a tougher approach. \u201cThe current reform proposals from Congress look anemic in light of the serious issues raised by the second circuit,\u201d said the ACLU director, Anthony Romero. \u201cCongress needs to up its reform game if it\u2019s going to address the court\u2019s concerns.\u201d Leading reformers in the Senate also urged Senator McConnell to allow a vote on the reform-minded USA Freedom Act rather than attempt to simply update existing legislation when it expires in a few days time. \u201cCongress should not reauthorize a bulk collection program that the court has found to violate the law,\u201d said a joint statement from Democratic senator Patrick Leahy and Republican Mike Lee. \u201c We will not consent to any extension of this program \u2026 We urge the majority leader to bring the USA Freedom Act up for a vote next week after the House passes it.\u201d But Senator McConnell initially appeared unconvinced despite the court\u2019s ruling, insisting that the White House\u2019s suggested alternative of having telephone companies retain data rather than the NSA was not an improvement. \u201cThe USA Freedom Act would replace Section 215 with an untested, untried and more cumbersome system,\u201d said the Republican majority leader. \u201cIt would not end bulk collection of call data. Instead, it would have untrained, corporate employees with uncertain supervision and protocols do the collecting. So it switches this responsibility from the NSA, with total oversight, to corporate employees with uncertain supervision and protocols.\u201d The original ruling against the ACLU from Judge William Pauley, a Clinton appointee to the southern district of New York, argued that al-Qaida\u2019s \u201cbold jujitsu\u201d strategy to marry seventh century ideology with 21st century technology made it imperative that government authorities be allowed to push privacy boundaries. But Thursday\u2019s appeal court ruling in New York, by circuit judges Robert Sack and Gerard Lynch and district judge Vernon Broderick, overturns that and forces the district court to hear a full challenge to the constitutionality of the NSA\u2019s behavior. \u201cThe government has pointed to no affirmative evidence \u2026 that suggests that Congress intended to preclude judicial review,\u201d said Lynch.\n", "title": "NSA mass phone surveillance revealed by Edward Snowden ruled illegal"}, {"date": "2015-05-09T11:30:03Z", "body": "One of the documents that Edward Snowden delivered to American journalists two years ago was a now-infamous NSA slide titled \u201cNew Collection Posture.\u201d The slide summarizes, in surprisingly candid terms, the objective of the largest, most powerful surveillance agency on the face of the earth. \u2018Collect it all\u2019, it says. The idea is that the NSA needs to vacuum up everything it can \u2014 because, well, one never knows what information might one day become useful. You can\u2019t find the needles unless you have a haystack, intelligence officials say. You can\u2019t connect the dots unless you first collect the dots. \u2018Collect it all\u2019 is a mentality, a mindset. But \u2018collect it all\u2019 is also a legal theory and the significance of Thursday\u2019s extraordinary ruling from an appeals court in New York is that it rejects this theory \u2014 or at least one manifestation of it. The government relies on a provision of the Patriot Act to collect the call records of hundreds of millions of Americans \u2014 the vast majority of them, needless to say, not suspected of having done anything wrong. On its face, the Patriot Act provision permits the government to collect records that are \u201crelevant\u201d to authorized investigations, but the government argues that everything is relevant because anything might be \u2014 one day. Thursday\u2019s decision rejects this argument categorically. \u201cThe interpretation the government asks us to adopt defies any limiting principle\u201d, the court writes. To adopt it, the court observes, would permit the government to appropriate any private collection of data into a government database for future review. This, the court writes: \u201cwould be an unprecedented contraction of the privacy expectations of all Americans.\u201d The decision focuses on the NSA\u2019s call-records program, but its implications are broader. This is because the same defective legal theory that underlies the call-records program is at work in some of the NSA\u2019s other mass-surveillance programs as well. The NSA once collected the internet metadata of millions of Americans, arguing that all of the data was relevant because some of it might be. The CIA is reported to be amassing records of international financial transactions on the same theory. And, until recently, the Drug Enforcement Administration operated its own massive call-records database. Right after the appeals court\u2019s decision, Senator Richard Burr, the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, appeared to disclose that the NSA is also collecting Americans\u2019 IP addresses in bulk, presumably in an effort to assemble a massive database documenting Americans\u2019 activities online. As Marcy Wheeler, who first noticed the disclosure, has since pointed out, the disclosure has mysteriously disappeared from the congressional record. There\u2019s some murkiness about precisely what Burr meant, but there\u2019s no question that Burr\u2019s IP-address dragnet would be an unremarkable extension of the government\u2019s collect-it-all logic. Thursday\u2019s decision was about the call-records program, but the government will have to consider its implications for other programs as well, including ones that have yet to be officially disclosed to the public. But perhaps the more immediate effect of Thursday\u2019s decision will be on the debate now unfolding in Washington. The Patriot Act provision that underlies the call-records program is scheduled to sunset on 1 June, and over the next three weeks Congress must decide whether to reauthorize the provision, scale it back or allow it to expire. The appeals court\u2019s decision should strengthen the hand of advocates who believe the revisions currently being considered by Congress don\u2019t go far enough, and it should strengthen the resolve of legislators who have been pushing for more comprehensive reforms. If Congress can\u2019t coalesce around more comprehensive reform, the best course would be to let Section 215 expire. The intelligence community hasn\u2019t even attempted to make a serious case that this authority is actually necessary. And as the recent ruling reminds us, it\u2019s an authority that\u2019s been grossly abused already and that could readily be abused again. The court has done its part.

Nor do they apply to surveillance conducted under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (Fisa), a law circumscribing the conduct and reach of surveillance aimed at people inside the United States. Instead, the rule change applies to surveillance under a highly influential and mostly secret Reagan-era executive order, known as 12333, which sets rules governing exclusively foreign-focused intelligence collection. Privacy advocates and whistleblowers have long pointed to broad latitude presented within 12333 that they contend provides a way of avoiding the ostensibly court-ordered surveillance of Fisa. Some said that the new rule change underscores their fears. \u201cThis development is very troubling for Americans\u2019 privacy,\u201d said John Napier Tye, a former state department official turned surveillance whistleblower. \u201cMost people don\u2019t realize this, but even our purely domestic email and text messages are often stored on servers outside the United States. And the NSA has written extremely permissive rules for itself to collect data outside US borders. \u201cSo in operations overseas, the NSA is scooping up a lot of purely domestic communications. And now, with these new rules, many different federal agencies can search and read the domestic communications of normal Americans, without any warrant or oversight from Congress or the courts.\u201d The changed rules will be inherited by the administration of Donald Trump following his inauguration next week, which comes in the wake of an extraordinary public dispute between the president-elect and the US intelligence agencies that concluded he was the beneficiary of interference by Russia in the presidential election. They mean that NSA officials are no longer required to filter out information about innocent people whose identities have been scooped up before passing the intercepted communications to officials from other agencies, who will now be able to search through raw caches of data. The rules state the head of another agency must make a written request for the intercepted communications that sets out how the agency will use and safeguard the data, how the data would further a particular mission and why it cannot be obtained another way. The NSA may, however, flag up potentially interesting data to other agencies \u201con its own initiative\u201d. Under the new procedures, a \u201chigh-level\u201d NSA official will be tasked with evaluating requests from sister intelligence agencies for access to the raw surveillance. The listed criteria for approving a request include the reasonableness of the request, a lack of available alternatives to acquire equivalently valuable information, and the ability of the requesting agency to \u201cprotect and handle raw [communications data] properly\u201d \u2013 a significant concern within the intelligence agencies after recent mass leaks. But the procedural changes do not set ironclad prohibitions for accessing raw data on Americans.\nWhile US intelligence agencies may not search through the raw data using query terms \u201cintended to select domestic communications\u201d, analysts are permitted under certain circumstances to examine foreign communications \u201cto, from or about a US person or a person located inside the United States if they are already subject to a Fisa court-authorized order\u201d. Additionally, the US attorney general or an intelligence agency chief can permit such searches against agents of a foreign power; a hostage or captive of a foreign power or terrorist; or to \u201cacquire significant foreign intelligence or counterintelligence information\u201d. Similarly, the rules prohibit the intelligence agencies from using search terms \u201clikely to result\u201d in retrieving Americans\u2019 communications, \u201cunless there is reason to believe that foreign intelligence or counterintelligence will be obtained by the use of such selection term\u201d. Under the rules of the 12333 order, intelligence officials are permitted to analyze all metadata \u2013 details such as who emailed whom, and from where \u2013 from Americans\u2019 communications that were gathered in the dragnet, but not the contents of the email or other electronic intercepts themselves. In a statement, Neema Singh Guliani, a legislative counsel for the ACLU, said the protections contained \u201cgrossly inadequate\u201d safeguards for personal data. \u201cThis raises serious concerns that agencies that have responsibilities such as prosecuting domestic crimes, regulating our financial policy, and enforcing our immigration laws will now have access to a wealth of personal information that could be misused,\u201d said Singh Guliani. \u201cCongress needs to take action to regulate and provide oversight over these activities.\u201d\n", "title": "Obama gives US intelligence greater access to warrantless data on foreigners"}, {"date": "2014-10-15T08:55:52Z", "body": "Mass surveillance of the internet by intelligence agencies is \u201ccorrosive of online privacy\u201d and threatens to undermine international law, according to a report to the United Nations general assembly. The critical study by Ben Emmerson QC, the UN\u2019s special rapporteur on counter-terrorism, released on Wednesday is a response to revelations by the whistleblower Edward Snowden about the extent of monitoring carried out by GCHQ in the UK and the National Security Agency (NSA) in the US. Emmerson\u2019s study poses a direct challenge to the claims of both governments that their bulk surveillance programs, which the barrister finds endanger the privacy of \u201cliterally every internet user,\u201d are proportionate to the terrorist threat and robustly constrained by law. To combat the danger, Emmerson endorses the ability of Internet users to mount legal challenges to bulk surveillance. \u201cBulk access technology is indiscriminately corrosive of online privacy and impinges on the very essence of the right guaranteed by [the UN\u2019s International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights],\u201d Emmerson, a prominent human rights lawyer, concludes. The programmes, he said, \u201cpose a direct and ongoing challenge to an established norm of international law.\u201d Article 17 of the covenant, Emmerson points out, states that \u201cno one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his or her privacy, family, home and correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his or her honour and reputation\u201d. The 22-page report warns that the use of mass surveillance technology, through interception programs developed by the NSA and GCHQ such as Prism and Tempora, \u201ceffectively does away with the right to privacy of communications on the internet altogether\u201d. It also highlights more intrusive methods, such as the NSA\u2019s Quantum program, which enables the agency to take \u201csecret control over servers in key locations\u201d and by impersonating websites \u201cinject unauthorized remote control software into the computers and Wi-Fi-enabled devices of those who visit the clone site\u201d. Most countries possess the technical capacity to intercept and monitor calls made on a landline or mobile telephone, enabling an individual\u2019s location to be determined, his or her movements to be tracked through cell site analysis and his or her text messages to be read and recorded, Emmerson says. An increasing number of countries also use malware systems that infiltrate individuals\u2019 computer or smartphone, to override settings and monitor its activity. But Emmerson differentiates between targeted surveillance, which follows a belief that its subject is involved in a specific act of wrongdoing, with bulk surveillance, which indiscriminately swallows up digital or telephonic communications data. The latter practice gives countries like the US and the UK access to an \u201ceffectively unlimited number of users,\u201d Emmerson writes. \u201cThis amounts to a systematic interference with the right to respect for the privacy of communications, and requires a correspondingly compelling justification,\u201d Emmerson maintains. \u201cMerely to assert \u2013 without particularization \u2013 that mass surveillance technology can contribute to the suppression and prosecution of acts of terrorism does not provide an adequate human rights law justification for its use. The fact that something is technically feasible, and that it may sometimes yield useful intelligence, does not by itself mean that it is either reasonable or lawful.\u201d The argument that anything online should be considered to be in the public domain is demolished by Emmerson. \u201cMerely using the internet as a means of private communication cannot conceivably constitute an informed waiver of the right to privacy,\u201d he states. \u201cThe internet is not a purely public space. It is composed of many layers of private as well as social and public realms.\u201d Mass surveillance of digital content and communications data is \u201ca serious challenge to an established norm of international law\u201d, according to the report. \u201cThe very existence of mass surveillance programmes constitutes a potentially disproportionate interference with the right to privacy. \u201cIt is incompatible with existing concepts of privacy for states to collect all communications or metadata all the time indiscriminately. The very essence of the right to the privacy of communication is that infringements must be exceptional, and justified on a case-by-case basis.\u201d Emmerson\u2019s report follows a finding this summer from Navi Pillay, the UN\u2019s high commissioner for human rights, that criticised the US and its allies for a \u201cdisturbing lack of transparency\u201d about their surveillance practices. Pillay stated in July that Snowden ought not to be prosecuted for disclosing the extent of the surveillance dragnets. Within the US, where a tumultuous year-long debate over surveillance reform appears to have stalled, intelligence officials insist that their surveillance activities are restrained by laws like the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (Fisa) and the Patriot Act - passed by the US Congress and subject the watchful judicial eye of the secret Fisa court. While Emmerson\u2019s report does not explicitly criticise the US, it rejects those assertions. The sheer volume of US surveillance, by its nature, cannot \u201cbe spelled out in legislation\u201d, meaning Americans\u2019 and foreigners\u2019 privacy rights can be violated \u201cwithout commensurate safeguards\u201d. Deriving authority for bulk surveillance from laws that, on their face, do not authorise the practice amount to \u201csecret legal frameworks\u201d, an echo of a criticism made by US senators Ron Wyden and Mark Udall. \u201cNothing short of detailed and explicit authorization in primary legislation suffices to meet the principle of legality,\u201d Emmerson writes. Emmerson also proposes a remedy for the vulnerability of digital communications data. \u201cAny Internet user,\u201d he concludes, ought to have legal standing to \u201cchallenge the legality, necessity and proportionality\u201d of mass surveillance. Courts in the US have not viewed that contention favourably. Before Snowden\u2019s leaks, several judges rejected legal challenges because those bringing the suit had no way of knowing their specific communications were collected. Even after Snowden disclosed the bulk collection of Americans\u2019 phone data, US justice department lawyers began arguing that surveillance only truly occurred once the collected communications data was analysed, something else users cannot know. During arguments in a New York federal court last month, government lawyers argued the judges themselves have no authority to review the NSA\u2019s bulk phone-records collection. The report refers to revelations first published in the Guardian last year about the NSA\u2019s mass collection of telecommunications data and its authorisation under a secret court order. \u201cThe right to privacy is not,\u201d Emmerson\u2019s report acknowledges, \u201can absolute right. Once an individual is under suspicion and subject to formal investigation by intelligence or law enforcement agencies, that individual may be subjected to surveillance for entirely legitimate counter-terrorism and law enforcement purposes.\u201d But he adds: \u201cThere is an urgent need for states to revise national laws regulating modern forms of surveillance to ensure that these practices are consistent with international human rights law. \u201cThe absence of clear and up-to-date legislation creates an environment in which arbitrary interferences with the right to privacy can occur without commensurate safeguards. Explicit and detailed laws are essential for ensuring legality and proportionality in this context.\u201d The report concludes: \u201cThe prevention and suppression of terrorism is a public interest imperative of the highest importance and may in principle form the basis of an arguable justification for mass surveillance of the internet. \u201cHowever, the technical reach of the programmes currently in operation is so wide that they could be compatible with article 17 of the covenant only if relevant States are in a position to justify as proportionate the systematic interference with the internet privacy rights of a potentially unlimited number of innocent people located in any part of the world.\u201d\n", "title": "Mass internet surveillance threatens international law, UN report claims"}, {"date": "2015-02-06T14:15:57Z", "body": "The UK Investigatory Powers Tribunal\u2019s ruling on Friday, that the regime that underpinned the sharing of bulk-collected intelligence between GCHQ and the NSA was unlawful until the end of last year, contradicts key statements made by leading political figures since the Guardian first published Edward Snowden\u2019s leaks about mass US and UK internet monitoring in 2013.\nThe tribunal declared on Friday: \u201cThe regime governing the soliciting, receiving, storing and transmitting by UK authorities of private communications of individuals located in the UK, which have been obtained by US authorities \u2026 contravened Articles 8 or 10\u201d of the European convention on human rights. Article 8 relates to the right to private and family life; article 10 refers to freedom of expression. Here are some of the comments made before the ruling about the legality of the programmes exposed by Snowden. David Cameron, British prime minister, 10 June 2013 I\u2019m satisfied that we have intelligence agencies that do a fantastically important job for this country to keep us safe and they operate within the law \u2026 I am satisfied from the questions I ask and always will continue to ask that they operate in a way that is proper and that is fitting. William Hague, British foreign secretary, 10 June 2013 Our agencies practise and uphold UK law at all times, even when dealing with information from outside the United Kingdom. It has been suggested that GCHQ uses our partnership with the United States to get around UK law, obtaining information that it cannot legally obtain in the United Kingdom. I wish to be absolutely clear that that accusation is baseless. Any data obtained by us from the United States involving UK nationals are subject to proper UK statutory controls and safeguards, including the relevant sections of the Intelligence Services Act, the Human Rights Act 1998, and the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act. Our intelligence-sharing work with the United States is subject to ministerial and independent oversight, and to scrutiny by the Intelligence and Security Committee \u2026 The combination of a robust legal framework, ministerial responsibility, scrutiny by the intelligence services commissioners, and parliamentary accountability through the intelligence and security committee [which monitors the work of the British security services] should give a high level of confidence that the system works as intended.\nTheresa May, British home secretary, 5 December 2014 The legal regimes that underpin the interception and intelligence-sharing activities of the agencies and their partners are both lawful and in line with our human rights obligations. Sir Malcom Rifkind, chairman of the UK\u2019s intelligence and security committee, 13 July 2013 Stories in the media have asserted that GCHQ had access to [US surveillance programme] Prism and thereby to the content of communications in the UK without proper authorisation. It is argued that, in so doing, GCHQ circumvented UK law. This is a matter of very serious concern: if true, it would constitute a serious violation of the rights of UK citizens. It has been alleged that GCHQ circumvented UK law by using the NSA\u2019s Prism programme to access the content of private communications. From the evidence we have seen, we have concluded that this is unfounded. Although we have concluded that GCHQ has not circumvented or attempted to circumvent UK law, it is proper to consider further whether the current statutory framework governing access to private communications remains adequate. In some areas the legislation is expressed in general terms and more detailed policies and procedures have, rightly, been put in place around this work by GCHQ in order to ensure compliance with their statutory obligations under the Human Rights Act 1998.\n", "title": "UK-US surveillance regime: statements by political figures before the ruling"}, {"date": "2015-02-23T22:35:31Z", "body": "Good morning folks, and welcome to the Morning Mail \u2013 sign up here to get it straight to your inbox every weekday morning.

In a recording obtained by the West Australian newspaper, Johnston warns an audience of defence industry representatives to expect more damaging intelligence leaks courtesy of the US National Security Agency contractor-turned-whistleblower, Edward Snowden. \u201cWe must assume the worst,\u201d Johnston said. \"Suffice to say it's an area that I can't get into in great detail, but I simply say assume the worst. \u201cWe are watching with great acuity what is happening in the space.\u201d His remarks follow the latest revelation by Guardian Australia on Monday that Australia's surveillance agency offered in 2008 to share information collected about ordinary Australian citizens with its major intelligence partners. According to a working draft memo recording the discussions in 2008, the Australian intelligence agency, then known as the Defence Signals Directorate, indicated it could share bulk material without some of the privacy restraints imposed by other countries, such as Canada. The conversation referred to metadata \u2013 the information we all generate whenever we use technology, from the date and time of a phone call to the location from which an email is sent. It is unclear what if any decisions or specific actions followed the 2008 meeting at Britain\u2019s GCHQ, at its headquarters in Cheltenham, on 22-23 April, 2008. Johnston is the minister responsible for the Australian Signals Directorate.

In comments apparently confirming co-operative surveillance activities, Johnston said the group had \u201cinvested far too much in this space to allow the event [the leaks] \u2026 to even contemplate a backward step\u201d. The group to which Johnston refers is Australia and its major intelligence-sharing partners, the US, Britain, Canada and New Zealand.

The former secretary of state dialled down her previous rhetoric about the whistleblower and hardened her tone towards the NSA while addressing a conference on women in Silicon Valley. The presumptive Democratic frontrunner for the 2016 presidential race also endorsed the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s (FCC) plan for net neutrality regulations, aligning herself with those who believe information and services should have a level playing field online. Clinton made the comments in a question and answer session following a keynote address to technology executives at the \u201cLead On\u201d conference in Santa Clara, organised by Watermark. Asked by Kara Swisher, a journalist and founder of the news site Re/code, if Snowden was a traitor, Clinton replied: \u201cI could never condone what he did. He stole millions of documents ... many of those documents had nothing to do with civil liberties.\u201d The criticism was notably milder compared to last year when she assailed the NSA leaker\u2019s \u201coutrageous behaviour\u201d and accused him of aiding terrorists and foes of the United States. Clinton rebuked the NSA with unusually blunt language, saying the agency needed to be more transparent and regain public trust in the wake of Snowden\u2019s revelations. \u201cPeople felt betrayed. \u2018You didn\u2019t tell us you were doing this.\u2019\u201d Since Snowden\u2019s leaks put the NSA under scrutiny from June 2013 the former first lady has steered a cautious course, making occasional swipes at Snowden and vague reprimands of the NSA while stressing the difficulty of balancing privacy and national security concerns.

The commission\u2019s chairman, Tom Wheeler, has called for an even playing field under Title II of the Communications Act, a law previously used for utility services like phone lines. \u201cI would vote for net neutrality because, as I understand it, it\u2019s Title II with a lot of changes within it in order to avoid the worst of the utility regulations,\u201d said Clinton. \u201cIt\u2019s a foot in the door.

You know, we\u2019re going to have to make some choices as a society,\u201d Obama said on 7 June 2013, two days after the Guardian, thanks to whistleblower Edward Snowden, began revealing the reach of US surveillance. The Snowden revelations began a process of classic Obama vacillation, bringing him from public defender of domestic mass surveillance to its reluctant and partial critic. It was a path crafted by politics, accelerated by law and fueled by fear. On 1 June 2015, after the Senate conceded it would pass a bill ending the phone records dragnet, Obama\u2019s spokesman claimed full ownership of the end of a program the US president had two years before said posed mere \u201cmodest encroachments on privacy\u201d. \u201cTo the extent that we\u2019re talking about the president\u2019s legacy, I would suspect that that would be a logical conclusion from some historians that the president ended some of these programs,\u201d said the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest. Many of those who voted for Obama thought that was the president they would get on day one of his tenure. They had good reason to think so. A former constitutional law professor, Obama began his national political career at the 2004 Democratic convention, where he gestured toward dissatisfaction with the emerging US surveillance apparatus: \u201cWe don\u2019t like federal agents poking around our libraries.\u201d But they also had less prominent warnings that Obama was more comfortable with that apparatus than he let on. In July 2008, with the Democratic presidential nomination in hand, Obama cast a Senate vote to expand the NSA\u2019s grasp, retroactively blessing a program that secretly collected Americans\u2019 international communications in bulk. The bill Obama voted for extended the powers that ultimately created the internet dragnet known as Prism. Once in power, Obama embraced domestic bulk data collection \u2013 even as the NSA\u2019s massive appetite for phone records was in secret legal peril. A judge on the typically pliant foreign intelligence surveillance court, or Fisa court, was so incensed that the NSA\u2019s software for querying US phone records went beyond the technological boundaries described to the panel that he effectively shut down NSA access to the data for much of 2009. Yet Obama continued the program. Similarly, Obama permitted the NSA to gather Americans\u2019 internet records in bulk until 2011 \u2013 and only disclosed that he shut the program down in response to the Guardian\u2019s post-Snowden queries. It remains unclear why Obama ended it. But a recent Justice Department report makes clear that the FBI has for years been amassing \u201clarge collections\u201d of the same data, raising questions about the meaningfulness of Obama\u2019s actions. But Obama\u2019s defense of bulk surveillance began to show cracks as the Guardian, the Washington Post, the Intercept, Der Spiegel and publications worldwide continued publishing revelations from Snowden\u2019s treasure troves. In August 2013, Obama announced he would empanel surveillance reviews to examine the programs\u2019 necessity.\nThose reviews savaged the domestic phone records collection. His own advisory body, heavy with intelligence veterans, told him in December 2013 to end the program. The government\u2019s privacy watchdog agreed in harsher tones, judging that it never prevented a terrorist attack and was illegal. The NSA never conceded the illegality, even as a federal judge said the \u201calmost Orwellian\u201d program was probably unconstitutional, but abandoned its previous insistence that it was vital for counter-terrorism. Obama agreed in January 2014 to divest NSA of its domestic phone records collection and called on Capitol Hill, where the NSA had not lost a fight since 1978, to pass legislation. But his administration was conspicuously silent on the leading congressional push for surveillance reform. It was called the USA Freedom Act, and it had an unlikely architect. James Sensenbrenner, the Wisconsin Republican who authored the 2001 Patriot Act, pronounced himself stunned not just by the bulk collection, but how the NSA had justified it on a part of his law, known as Section 215. Despite Obama\u2019s reversal, Sensenbrenner and his allies received the cold shoulder from the White House. Administration officials refused to publicly indicate their support or opposition to the Freedom Act. At a 4 February 2014 hearing, members of the House judiciary committee predicted they would either back the bill or watch as the House failed to reauthorize Section 215 the following year.\nThe NSA did not like the Freedom Act, which went further than shutting down bulk phone records collection. It banned the NSA and FBI from warrantlessly querying hoards of international communications for Americans\u2019 data, permanently put a privacy advocate on the Fisa court and permitted greater transparency for the companies receiving surveillance orders. But the NSA could not get its preferred legislation, from its allies on the House intelligence committee, through a skeptical Congress. So it began working with the Freedom Act architects to soften the bill\u2019s restrictions. Intelligence-agency lawyers met with House GOP potentates and Freedom Act architects in May 2014 after the bill passed the judiciary committee. By the time discussions ended, the Freedom Act would bear only superficial resemblance to what committee members voted for. Gone was the so-called \u201cbackdoor search\u201d ban. All the privacy and transparency restrictions were weakened, without any vote, to the point where the bill\u2019s vague definitions left unclear how much bulk surveillance it actually banned. A judiciary committee member and mass-surveillance critic, Democrat Zoe Lofgren of California, observed: \u201cThis is not how American democracy is supposed to work.\u201d Yet the House passed the bill that month by a wide margin. As they watched privacy groups abandon support, the bill\u2019s architects defended the compromises out of political reality. They had a product that would end NSA bulk domestic phone records collection, reform the Fisa court somewhat, and provide more surveillance transparency than the status quo. They had also quieted the objections of the NSA and its allies and produced a bill that was passable in both senses of the word. And they had a belated White House endorsement. But the Freedom Act did not have the US Senate\u2019s support. Republicans set up procedural obstructions to kill it using a tried and true method: the specter of a terrorist attack. \u201cGod forbid we wake up tomorrow and [the Islamic State] is in the United States,\u201d Florida Republican Marco Rubio said in a typical comment. Despite Obama\u2019s allies pushing through a vote during the final weeks of Democratic Senate control, the USA Freedom Act failed in November 2014.\nSo the Freedom Act\u2019s architects regrouped. To revive the bill in 2015, they set about placing surveillance advocates on the horns of the dilemma they had warned about the previous year: either pass the bill or lose a broader swath of FBI surveillance powers. For good measure, they conceded even more to the NSA\u2019s allies. The strategy depended on introducing the bill just weeks before the Patriot Act portions it needed for leverage expired. Meanwhile, bulk collection grew less tenable: a federal appeals court, the final step before the US supreme court, ruled it was illegal. The House passed the bill on 16 May. GOP presidential candidate Rand Paul, the rare Senate Republican to oppose bulk surveillance, used procedural obstructions of his own to force the partial Patriot Act expiration this week \u2013 which ultimately ensured passage of the Freedom Act on Tuesday afternoon by a wide, bipartisan, 67-32 margin. Paul considers the bill insufficient. His allies in the House are now preparing to supplement it. They outlined to the Guardian on Tuesday a strategy to chip away at more of the NSA\u2019s bulk surveillance powers, as well as its ability to insert flaws in encryption software standards. Cognizant that the USA Freedom Act leaves the vast majority of NSA powers untouched, they said they intend to fight for years \u2013 particularly through 2017, when the bill Obama voted for as a senator in July 2008 expires. Obama will be gone from office by then. But his vacillations over surveillance continue. No sooner had the Freedom Act passed, than an administration official confirmed to the Guardian that the NSA would actually restart the bulk surveillance the bill bans \u2013 for another six months, to \u201ctransition\u201d to a system where the telecom companies retain control of the data and provide it to the NSA or the FBI based on a court order that does not even require the typical probable-cause standard.\nSnowden remains a pariah stranded in Russia, facing jail time for telling Americans about what their government was doing secretly, and illegally, in their name. Obama has never shown Snowden the slightest regard. But Obama\u2019s caveated, cautious and mutable stances on surveillance have earned him no allies. Despite his endless defenses of the NSA, its veterans demanded greater deference. Civil libertarians now view Obama as a tragic disappointment. With Hillary Clinton a longstanding security hawk, their only presidential hope is Rand Paul. After the Freedom Act passed on Tuesday, Obama gave no indication that further reforms to the vast, labyrinthine apparatus of surveillance he commands are needed. Instead, he issued a statement praising the passage and insisting the bill will \u201cprovide greater public confidence in these programs\u201d, which has been the NSA\u2019s explicit goal since the Snowden leaks began on 5 June 2013. Obama\u2019s statement did one more thing. He portrayed himself as a stalwart and consistent champion of surveillance reform : \u201cFor the past 18 months, I have called for reforms that better safeguard the privacy and civil liberties of the American people while ensuring our national security officials retain tools important to keeping Americans safe.\u201d It was a gesture toward history, toward the kind of president Obama might have been.\n", "title": "Barack Obama and surveillance reform: a story of vacillation, caution and fear"}, {"date": "2016-04-16T22:15:13Z", "body": "Edward Snowden has condemned Australian law enforcement for collecting the communications records of a Guardian journalist without a warrant. The world\u2019s most prominent whistleblower, who disclosed dragnet surveillance unprecedented in its scale by the National Security Agency and its allies, singled out for critique the Australian government\u2019s contention that it broke no laws in its leak investigation of Paul Farrell, a Guardian reporter who in 2014 exposed the inner workings of Australia\u2019s maritime interception of asylum seekers.\n\u201cPolice in developed democracies don\u2019t pore over journalists\u2019 private activities to hunt down confidential sources,\u201d Snowden told the Guardian. \u201cThe Australian federal police are defending such operations as perfectly legal, but that\u2019s really the problem, isn\u2019t it? Sometimes the scandal is not what law was broken, but what the law allows.\u201d Throughout 2015 the Australian parliament enacted a series of controversial laws that curbed privacy and freedom of expression rights. Geoffrey King, director of the Committee to Protect Journalists\u2019 Technology Program, said the AFP\u2019s actions were \u201cobviously outrageous\u201d. \u201cThis should not be happening. But it is the inevitable result of mandatory data retention and mass surveillance, which is neither necessary nor proportional to any threat,\u201d King said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t line up with the values that we all adhere to, to good counter-terrorism strategy, and it certainly doesn\u2019t line up with a free and open society where journalists can do their jobs.\u201d In March 2015 the Australian Senate passed legislation requiring internet and mobile phone companies to retain customer metadata for 24 months. The bill was vehemently opposed by the Australian Greens, whose communications spokesman, Senator Scott Ludlam, called its new provisions a \u201cform of mass surveillance\u201d. Although a last-minute amendment obliged security agencies to get a warrant before accessing a journalist\u2019s metadata, the law essentially expands the Australian government\u2019s ability to conduct dragnet surveillance. Australia, along with the US, UK, Canada and New Zealand, is part of the Five Eyes signals-intelligence sharing network. Documents leaked by Snowden in 2013 revealed that Australian spying authorities had offered to share bulk metadata of ordinary Australian citizens with their partners in the Five Eyes network. Other documents Snowden leaked revealed Australian spies had attempted to listen in to the phone calls of former Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and his inner circle, causing an extended diplomatic rift between the two countries. The investigation into Farrell\u2019s sources, for a story relating to the activities of an Australian customs vessel and a controversial operation to turn back a boat carrying asylum seekers from Indonesia, was conducted in 2014, before the amendment passed parliament. Law enforcement did not need a warrant for accessing the information at the time. The case marks the first time the AFP has confirmed seeking access to a journalist\u2019s metadata in a specific case, although the agency has admitted to investigating several journalists reporting on Australian immigration. The acknowledgement that authorities had sought access to Farrell\u2019s records was only divulged after the reporter lodged a complaint with Australia\u2019s privacy commissioner under the country\u2019s Privacy Act.\nIn July 2015, the Australian government passed the Border Force Act, which criminalises whistleblowing from within Australia\u2019s hardline immigration detention network, making it an offense punishable with up to two years in prison. The country\u2019s \u201cOperation Sovereign Borders\u201d, a harsh, military-led crackdown on asylum seekers who attempt to enter Australia by boat, includes a policy of turning back boats carrying migrants and deporting every arrival including children to harsh, offshore detention centres in Papua New Guinea and the tiny Pacific island state of Nauru, for permanent resettlement.\n", "title": "Edward Snowden on police pursuing journalist data: the scandal is what the law allows"}, {"date": "2015-04-15T11:15:04Z", "body": "With about 45 days remaining before a major post-9/11 surveillance authorization expires, representatives of the National Security Agency and the FBI are taking to Capitol Hill to convince legislators to preserve their sweeping spy powers. That effort effectively re-inaugurates a surveillance debate in Congress that has spent much of 2015 behind closed doors. Within days, congressional sources tell the Guardian, the premiere NSA reform bill of the last Congress, known as the USA Freedom Act, is set for reintroduction \u2013 and this time, some former supporters fear the latest version of the bill will squander an opportunity for even broader surveillance reform. Republican leaders of the House intelligence committee arranged for NSA and FBI representatives to hold secret briefings for members of Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday. Staff did not name the officials addressing legislators. The classified briefings come amid an unsettled surveillance debate in Congress that rushes up against an unforgiving deadline. On 1 June, Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which permits US law enforcement and surveillance agencies to collect business records, expires. Section 215 is the authority claimed by the NSA since 2006 for its ongoing daily bulk collection of US phone records revealed by the Guardian in 2013 thanks to leaks from whistleblower Edward Snowden. While the Obama administration and US intelligence agencies last year supported divesting the NSA of its domestic phone metadata collection, a bill to do so failed in November. But the FBI and its supporters fear that the expiration of Section 215 will cut deeper than the loss of bulk collection. The FBI is warning that it will lose access to investigative leads for domestic terrorism and espionage, such as credit card information, hotel records and more, outside normal warrant or subpoena channels. While the briefings were not described as a platform for defending the controversial Section 215, they \u201coffer an important opportunity to hear directly from analysts and operators who use Section 215 as part of their daily mission to protect the Nation from terrorist attacks,\u201d according to an announcement for legislators sent by intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes and Georgia Republican Lynn Westmoreland and obtained by the Guardian. Civil-libertarian members who attended left unsatisfied. \u201cOur questions about constitutionality and legality were answered with statements of efficacy. We said, \u2018How can this possibly be legal?\u2019 and they would say, \u2018this program works great, here\u2019s how it\u2019s helping us catch terrorists,\u2019\u201d Representative Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, told the Guardian. Yet with Section 215\u2019s lifespan now stretching to a matter of weeks, supporters of broad surveillance powers have yet to put forth a bill for their preservation \u2013 evidence, opponents believe, that the votes for reauthorization do not exist, particularly not in the House of Representatives. Members of the intelligence and judiciary committees in both chambers are still negotiating behind closed doors to determine the shape of a vehicle to reauthorize 215. A spokeswoman for Senator Richard Burr, the North Carolina Republican who leads the Senate intelligence committee, had no information to offer on Tuesday. Senator Dan Coats, an Indiana Republican, left an afternoon intelligence committee meeting saying the shape of a reauthorization was under \u201congoing discussion\u201d. A different congressional source said Senate GOP leadership was \u201cclinging to the pipe dream\u201d of a straight reauthorization. More likely, according to a multiple Hill sources, is a different option under consideration: making the major NSA reform bill of the last Congress the point of departure for reauthorizing 215 in the current one. That bill, the USA Freedom Act, passed the House in May 2014 before narrowly failing in November in the Senate. Belatedly, the White House endorsed it, after seeing it had a greater chance of passage than any pro-NSA alternative. Yet the House version lost substantial civil-libertarian support after the intelligence agencies and House leadership weakened its surveillance restrictions, including its central prohibition on the bulk collection of domestic phone records. Advocates of the bill in both congressional chambers, including its original architects, have been laboring for eight weeks in marathon negotiations to revive the USA Freedom Act. The revived bill would extend the expiring provisions of the Patriot Act for a still-undetermined number of years \u2013 essentially staking out the center of the 2015-era surveillance debate for a bill that would take NSA out of the domestic bulk-collection business. Advocates believe they are close enough to agreement that reintroduction could come as early as Thursday and would move through the judiciary committees. But several privacy activists inside and outside Congress consider the USA Freedom Act insufficient. The bill would not abridge NSA collection of Americans\u2019 international communications, nor prevent the NSA or the FBI from warrantlessly searching through its troves of them for Americans\u2019 identifying information. Nor would it restrict a constellation of surveillance efforts authorized by a Reagan-era executive order. Even a recently disclosed bulk domestic phone records collection dragnet by the Drug Enforcement Agency would be untouched. \u201cWe should be demanding more reforms than the intelligence agencies are gladly willing to offer us,\u201d said David Segal of the activist group Demand Progress. Last month, Massie co-sponsored a bill introduced by Wisconsin Democrat Mark Pocan going much further. The Surveillance State Repeal Act would repeal the entire Patriot Act and a landmark 2008 expansion of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. As well, the bill carries protections for national-security whistleblowers against retaliation and makes probable cause the basis for foreign-intelligence surveillance of an American or someone on US soil. But the bill, with only ten current co-sponsors, faces questions about its viability, which even Massie concedes. \u201cIt\u2019s very long odds, but it\u2019s a statement about what needs to happen. It\u2019s a stronger Freedom Act that\u2019s not going to get watered down,\u201d Massie said. After the NSA briefing on Tuesday, Massie said he sees a \u201ctremendous opportunity\u201d for surveillance reform, and said he thinks the newest members of Congress are likely to determine the fate of the expiring Patriot Act provisions. \u201cA lot of it is going to hinge on the freshmen. Right now, as far as I can tell, the select intelligence committee is making a real strong play to persuade the freshmen that all of these public concerns are overblown,\u201d Massie said.

Look no further than a series of explosive investigations by various news organizations this week that show the government hiding surveillance programs purely to prevent a giant public backlash. USA Today\u2019s Brad Heath published a blockbuster story on Monday about the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) running a massive domestic spying operation parallel to the NSA\u2019s that was tracking billions of international calls made by Americans. They kept it secret for more than two decades. According to the USA Today report, the spying program was not only used against alleged terrorist activity, but countless supposed drug crimes, as well as \u201cto identify US suspects in a wide range of other investigations\u201d. And they collected information on millions of completely innocent Americans along the way. Heath\u2019s story is awash with incredible detail and should be read in full, but one of the most interesting parts was buried near the end: the program was shut down by the Justice Department after the Snowden leaks, not because Snowden exposed the program, but because they knew that when the program eventually would leak, the government would have no arguments to defend it. The justification they were using for the NSA\u2019s program - that it was only being used against dangerous terrorists, not ordinary criminals - just wasn\u2019t true with the DEA. The public would clearly be outraged by the twisted legal justification that radically re-interpreted US law in complete secrecy. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t defend both programs\u201d, a former Justice Department official told Heath. The piece also reveals that Attorney General Eric Holder \u201cdidn\u2019t think we should have that information\u201d in the first place, which is interesting because Holder was one of the first Justice Department officials to approve the program during the Clinton administration. It\u2019s nice he came to his senses, but if the program never risked going public, would he have felt the same? There are many other surveillance programs the government is desperate to keep hidden. Consider Stingray devices, the mini fake cell phone towers that can vacuum up cell phone data of entire neighborhoods at the same time and which are increasingly being used by local cops all around the country. The Associated Press reported this week that the Baltimore police have used these controversial devices thousands of times in the course of ordinary investigations and have tried to hide how the devices are used from judges. The lengths to which the FBI will go to keep these devices secret from the public is alarming. As a Guardian investigation detailed on Friday, the FBI makes local police that use them sign non-disclosure agreements, and goes as far as to direct them to dismiss charges against potential criminals if the phone surveillance will be exposed at trial (as is required by due process rights in the Fifth Amendment). The AP recounted this extraordinary courtroom exchange about the non-disclosure agreements that took place between a defense attorney and a Baltimore detective: \u201cDoes it instruct you to withhold evidence from the state\u2019s attorney and the circuit court of Baltimore city, even if upon order to produce?\u201d asked defense attorney Joshua Insley. \u201cYes,\u201d Cabreja replied, saying he spoke with the FBI last week about the case. Why is the FBI going so far as to ignore judges\u2019 court orders and basically obstruct justice? The government has claimed in the past that it doesn\u2019t want what director Jim Comey refers to as \u201cbad people\u201d finding out how this technology works. But the details are widely available online, and have been reported on in detail by virtually every major news organization. It\u2019s more likely that the FBI is trying to prevent the inevitable fallout when they have to admit that they are sucking up the cell phone information of thousands of innocent people - and the fourth amendment challenges that would follow. If the government wants to use mass surveillance techniques against the public, that should be up to the public, not a decision made in secret knowing ordinary Americans would freak out if they found out.\n", "title": "The government hides surveillance programs just because people would freak out | Trevor Timm"}, {"date": "2015-04-22T12:52:21Z", "body": "Mass surveillance should be retained because of the prospect of Islamic State attacks within the United States, a key Republican ally of the National Security Agency has claimed. Mike Rogers, the former chairman of the House intelligence committee, said the NSA needed to preserve its wide powers in case Isis used its bases in Syria and Iraq to unleash atrocities on the US homeland. \u201cNow you have a very real face on what the threat is,\u201d Rogers told the Guardian on Tuesday. \u201cSomebody calling back from Syria to Minnesota, either recruiting somebody or giving the operational OK to do something. That\u2019s real and it\u2019s serious. Before it seemed all hypothetical. Now you can see it.\u201d He added: \u201cThink about how many people are in Syria with western passports or even American passports. I want to know if they pick up the phone. If they\u2019re calling back to the States, I don\u2019t know about you, but I want to know who they\u2019re talking to and what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d Rogers gave the warning as negotiators in the House of Representatives wrangled over a revamp of the USA Freedom Act, a bill that aimed to stop the NSA from its daily collection of US phone records in bulk which failed in the Senate in 2014, and is now returning to Congress. A coalition of civil libertarian groups on the left and right wants a landmark law to reform the intelligence services in the wake of revelations to the Guardian by Edward Snowden, the NSA whistleblower. Part of the Patriot Act known as section 215, which the NSA uses to justify domestic mass surveillance, expires on 1 June. Reformers hope that deadline will give them the leverage to make sure the Freedom Act only reauthorises those provisions on condition of much greater privacy protections. Republicans, however, are signalling possible resistance. Senator Charles Grassley, the powerful chair of the Senate judiciary committee, whose support is crucial, told reporters on Tuesday he had concerns about \u201cfinding a balance between national security and privacy\u201d in the bill. The National Journal reported that the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, may try to thwart reformers by introducing a bill that would reauthorise section 215 until 2020. Rogers, speaking in a brief interview after addressing the Rand Corporation thinktank in Los Angeles, sought to persuade Democrats and his fellow Republicans of the need to keep extensive surveillance, and expressed hope that \u201ccooler heads\u201d in Congress will renew section 215 without ceding big concessions to reformers. Nadia Kayyali, an activist with the digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation, said reauthorising the provision without comprehensive reform would be against the constitution. \u201cEnding the bulk collection of phone records under section 215 is the first step in reforming the NSA. The time for Congress to take that step is now.\u201d She said NSA defenders would falsely claim that it was necessary to keep the mass surveillance. \u201cBut the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, the President\u2019s Review Group, and senators who are familiar with how bulk phone records collection works have all said we don\u2019t need the program.\u201d Kayyali accused reform opponents of peddling fear and discredited claims, such as mass surveillance having stopped 54 terrorist attacks. \u201cWe hope at least Congress has some frank, truthful discussion about NSA spying as we head towards the 1 June deadline.\u201d In his address to the Rand Corporation audience Rogers, a former FBI agent, painted a dark picture of terrorists and other enemies exploiting the naivety and complacency of certain Americans \u2013 including Barack Obama \u2013 who did not grasp the urgency of nurturing and projecting US power. He lamented that the uproar over Snowden\u2019s leaks gave the public a \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d impression about NSA collection of metadata, which he compared to a postman noting an envelope\u2019s addressee and sender. \u201cIt got so distorted, as if the government was collecting everything and hoarding it in the basement and couldn\u2019t wait to find out about Aunt May\u2019s bunions. The political narrative got ahead of the facts. It was very frustrating.\u201d Rogers, a close ally of John Boehner, the House majority leader, expressed confidence Congress would strike an acceptable balance. \u201cI\u2019m hoping cooler heads will prevail knowing what we have now. I mean, Isis is a mess. And this interconnected world we live in, with these folks having the ability to get back to the United States, is really troubling.

The court order, imposed by the district court for the northern district of Texas at the request of the US government, prohibits the defendant and his defence team, as well as prosecutors, from making \"any statement to members of any television, radio, newspaper, magazine, internet (including, but not limited to, bloggers), or other media organization about this case, other than matters of public interest.\" It goes on to warn Brown and his lawyers that \"no person covered by this order shall circumvent its effect by actions that indirectly, but deliberately, bring about a violation of this order\". According to Dell Cameron of Vice magazine, who attended the hearing, the government argued that the gag order was needed in order to protect Brown from prejudicing his right to a fair trial by making comments to reporters. But media observers seen the hearing in the opposite light: as the latest in a succession of prosecutorial moves under the Obama administration to crack-down on investigative journalism, official leaking, hacking and online activism. Brown's lead defence attorney, Ahmed Ghappour, has countered in court filings, the most recent of which was lodged with the court Wednesday, that the government's request for a gag order is unfounded as it is based on false accusations and misrepresentations. The lawyer says the gagging order is a breach of Brown's first amendment rights as an author who continues to write from his prison cell on issues unconnected to his own case for the Guardian and other media outlets. In his memo to the court for today's hearing, Ghappour writes that Brown's July article for the Guardian \"contains no statements whatsoever about this trial, the charges underlying the indictment, the alleged acts underlying the three indictments against Mr Brown, or even facts arguably related to this prosecution.\" The gag order does give Brown some room to carry on his journalistic work from prison. It says that he will be allowed to continue publishing articles on topics \"not related to the counts on which he stands indicted\". Following the imposition of the order, Ghappour told the Guardian: \"The defense's overriding concern is that Mr Brown continue to be able to exercise his first amendment right as a journalist. The order preserves that ability.\" The lawyer adds that since the current defence team took over in May, Brown has made only three statements to the media, two of which where articles that did not concern his trial while the third ran no risk of tainting the jury pool. \"Defendant believes that a gag order is unwarranted because there is no substantial, or even reasonable, likelihood of prejudice to a fair trial based on statements made by defendant or his counsel since May 1, 2013.\" Brown, 32, was arrested in Dallas on 12 September last year and has been in prison ever since, charged with 17 counts that include threatening a federal agent, concealing evidence and disseminating stolen information. He faces a possible maximum sentence of 100 years in custody. Before his arrest, Brown became known as a specialist writer on the US government's use of private military contractors and cybersecurity firms to conduct online snooping on the public. He was regularly quoted by the media as an expert on Anonymous, the loose affiliation of hackers that caused headaches for the US government and several corporate giants, and was frequently referred to as the group's spokesperson, though he says the connection was overblown. In 2011, through the research site he set up called Project PM, he investigated thousands of emails that had been hacked by Anonymous from the computer system of a private security firm, HB Gary Federal. His work helped to reveal that the firm had proposed a dark arts effort to besmirch the reputations of WikiLeaks supporters and prominent liberal journalists and activists including the Guardian's Glenn Greenwald. In 2012, Brown similarly pored over millions of emails hacked by Anonymous from the private intelligence company Stratfor. It was during his work on the Stratfor hack that Brown committed his most serious offence, according to US prosecutors \u2013 he posted a link in a chat room that connected users to Stratfor documents that had been released online. The released documents included a list of email addresses and credit card numbers belonging to Stratfor subscribers. For posting that link, Brown is accused of disseminating stolen information \u2013 a charge with media commentators have warned criminalises the very act of linking. As Geoffrey King, Internet Advocacy Coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists, has put it, the Barrett Brown case \"could criminalize the routine journalistic practice of linking to documents publicly available on the internet, which would seem to be protected by the first amendment to the US constitution under current doctrine\". In its motion to the Dallas district court, US prosecutors accuse Brown and his associates of having \"solicited the services of the media or media-types to discuss his case\" and of continuing to \"manipulate the public through press and social media comments\". It further accuses Ghappour of \"co-ordinating\" and \"approving\" the use of the media, and alleges that between them they have spread \"gross fabrications and substantially false recitations of facts and law which may harm both the government and the defence during jury selection\". But Ghappour in his legal response has pointed out that several of the specific accusations raised by the government are inaccurate. Prosecutors refer to an article in the Guardian by Greenwald published on 21 March 2013 based partly on an interview between the journalist and Brown, yet as Ghappour points out that piece was posted on the Guardian website before the accused's current legal team had been appointed. Under his legal advice, Ghappour writes, Brown has maintained \"radio silence\" over his case and has given no further interviews, thus negating the government's case for a gagging order.\n", "title": "US stops jailed activist Barrett Brown from discussing leaks prosecution"}, {"date": "2015-04-08T16:01:05Z", "body": "In less than 60 days, Congress - whether they like it or not - will be forced to decide if the NSA\u2019s most notorious mass surveillance program lives or dies. And today, over 30 civil liberties organizations launched a nationwide call-in campaign urging them to kill it. Despite doing almost everything in their power to avoid voting for substantive NSA reform, Congress now has no choice: On 1 June, one of the most controversial parts of the Patriot Act - known as Section 215 - will expire unless both houses of Congress affirmatively vote for it to be reauthorized. Section 215 of the Patriot Act was the subject of the very first Snowden story, when the Guardian reported that the US government had reinterpreted the law in complete secrecy, allowing the NSA to vacuum up every single American\u2019s telephone records - who they called, who called them, when, and for how long - regardless of whether they had been accused of a crime or not. (The NSA\u2019s warped interpretation of Section 215 was also the subject of John Oliver\u2019s entire show on Sunday night. It is a must-watch.) The massive phone dragnet is not the only thing Section 215 is used for though. As independent journalist Marcy Wheeler has meticulously documented, Section 215 is likely being used for all sorts of surveillance that the public has no idea about. There are an estimated 180 orders from the secret Fisa court that involve Section 215, but we know only five of them are directed at telecom companies for the NSA phone program. To give you a sense of the scale: the one Fisa order published by the Guardian from the Snowden trove compelled Verizon to hand over every phone record that it had on all its millions of customers. Every single one. While the government claims that its other uses of Section 215 are \u201ccritical\u201d to national security, it\u2019s extremely hard to take their word for it. After all, the government lied about collecting information on millions of Americans under Section 215 to begin with. Then they claimed the phone surveillance program was \u201ccritical\u201d to national security after it was exposed. That wasn\u2019t true either: they later had to admit it has never stopped a single terrorist attack. We also just learned two weeks ago that the NSA knew the program was largely pointless before the Snowden leaks and debated shutting it down altogether. Suddenly, after the Snowden documents became public, NSA officials defended it as \u201ccritical\u201d again when they had to go before an increasingly skeptical Congress. Is Section 215 being used to collect massive amounts of other data on Americans? Well, the New York Times reported last year that there are multiple different bulk collection programs under different authorities that are still secret. And Ron Wyden, while not specifying which law was being used, indicated in an interview last month that there were several spying programs directly affecting Americans that were still secret. And there\u2019s evidence to suggest they\u2019re doing so for supposed \u201ccyber\u201d crime investigations. Whatever else they\u2019re doing with Section 215 behind closed doors, the phone surveillance program is illegal. As the author of the Patriot Act, Republican Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner has said: \u201cI can say that without qualification that Congress never did intend to allow bulk collection when it passed Section 215, and no fair reading of the text would allow for this [mass phone surveillance] program\u201d. It\u2019s also likely unconstitutional, as the first federal judge to look at the program ruled almost a year ago. Judge Richard Leon wrote at the time in his landmark opinion: \u201cI cannot imagine a more \u2018indiscriminate\u2019 and \u2018arbitrary invasion\u2019 than this systematic and high-tech collection and retention of personal data on virtually every citizen for purposes of querying and analyzing it without prior judicial approval\u201d. These days, Congress can barely get post office names passed, let alone comprehensive reform on any subject affecting the American people. So the fact that they haven\u2019t passed NSA reform yet says more about their near-total dysfunction than the American public\u2019s views about privacy. But now they have no choice. A year and a half ago, the House came within a few votes of cutting off funding for Section 215 in an unorthodox appropriations vote and, since then, opposition to the NSA\u2019s massive spying operation on Americans has remained strong. Only time will tell if Congress will actually receive this message. But if citizens call their representatives, they might just get it. Then, come June, the NSA will have a lot less of our private data at their fingertips.

Issues ranged from protecting whistleblowers, methods of investigation, a speech from Daniel Ellsberg the Pentagon papers whistleblower, what we can expect in the future, strategies of the future and a live video appearance from Julian Assange. Follow more coverage from the Guardian tomorrow. Have a good evening!\nAnd that\u2019s it for questions with Julian Assange.\nI asked Julian Assange how the Guardian \u201ctrapped\u201d him in the UK. He said he thought he had one newspaper, a decent newspaper in his corner, and thought he would have a significant chance in legal process. Then he attacked the Guardian, alleging:\nI am sure senior Guardian staff who dealt with Assange will have a different version of events.\nAssange is asked about the sexual allegations: \u201cI wish people would understand the details, but no-one wants to report the details.\u201d \u201cI have been detained for four years.\u201d \u201cThere is a growing realisation of how unfair it is\u201d, he says. \u201cIn Sweden they have also come to greater realisation\u201d, that the prosecution was in violation alleges Assange. Assange asks: It\u2019s extremely interesting that the details of the women in the case, they didn\u2019t want to file a complaint, why aren\u2019t those details reported in the UK?\nHere are a round-up of tweets:\nJulian Assange says he has an insight of the UK, and makes a dig at The Guardian: Being trapped in the UK by the Guardian newspaper \u2013 that\u2019s why I was here\u201d Adding: I had impression of being patted on the head\u201d\nOn the court decision announced yesterday, Assange said he had not read it but: It\u2019s no surprise. I despair of the United Kingdom.\u201d He adds: People born in the UK grow up in a very plastic class system, and it\u2019s why oligarchs prefer to set up home in the UK.\u201d\nAssange says when Edward Snowden was given asylum, supporters were secretive, \u201cbut it was speed which gave us the edge\u201d. \u201cAnd I think that is something to be optimistic about,\u201d Assange adds. He says that yes, big organisations such as the NSA have the resources \u2013 but the bigger the organsation the more incompoetemt and useless they are. So the ability to carry out an operation \u201cwithout cocking it up is pretty low\u201d.\nThe Wikileaks founder says: Let us not think that the only way to be effective is to be secretive. Speed and simultaneity are effective tools as well. Here\u2019s a vine of Assange speaking to the audience via video-link:\nAssange begins to discuss international relations, and discusses the intervetion in Libya: \u201cYes part of that was about expansionist pressure to grab Libyan oil. But he asks \u201cwhat is the purpose of the National Security Agency?\u201d It\u2019s to achieve power, Assange says. And to get these agencies need resources, according to the Wikileaks founder. Assange says power is found in two ways: Agencies tell the establishment, we can protect you. The other way is the appeal to greed. Assange explains that broadly speaking is the business of securitisation and empire. Adding: If we didn\u2019t have a muslim extremist threat, those organisations would not go away. They would simply roll over and find another excuse.\nJulian Assange, editor-in-chief of website WikiLeaks, speaks to the auditorium via video-link from the Ecuadorian embassy.\nHe begins by asking the audience: How many prisoners in the audience? How many Muslim journalists in the audience? Assange then says that: \u201cWhat is happening to the Muslim population is a travesty to the human population.\u201d\nAppelbaum, 31, tells the audience: \u201cyou need to live in a free society\u201d, if you want to use an iPhone. Which, \u201ccurrently you don\u2019t\u201d. He explains how the UK government has access to Apple data. According to the cyber-security analyst, he says that people who have grown up post 9/11 only know a security state. He adds that 1984 seems quite quaint now: Britain is a surveillance state.\nAppelbaum, connected to Wikileaks, takes a dig at the Guardian saying that we take the security of our content management system (CMS) as seriously as we take the protection of our sources seriously. I think the editors would have something to say about that...\nHe recommends using a cryptophone rather than a cell-phone. It works over Tor, and uses IP addresses from phone to phone.\nWe are joined by Jacob Appelbaum, an American independent computer security researcher and hacker. He was employed by the University of Washington, and is a core member of the Tor project, a free software network designed to provide online anonymity.\nHe says: In Pakistan, a cell-phone is a drone magnet.\u201d Or if you\u2019re using someone else\u2019s phone regularly, maybe you can get them killed instead.\u201d He can\u2019t be in London as he has concerns for his safety, so he\u2019s on video-link but not on Skype, which he calls \u201cabsolutely f-ing garbage\u201d:\nAnnie Machon, former MI5 intelligence officer, says that currently under RIPA the product of electronic intercept cannot be used against you in the court of law. But a bugged device in your workstation for example, can be used. Machon says that if intelligence security want to follow you, they won\u2019t have a guy in a grubby coat \u2013 there will be around 20 guys following you in a very sophisticated way. You have to be paranoid to escape surveillance, according to Machon. She says the most secure way is to write on a piece of paper and pass it under glass, then destroy the evidence.\nWe\u2019re on the fourth session of the day and will have talks by: Annie Machon on operational security Sander Venema on security dilemmas in publishing leaks Jacob Appelbaum on anonymity and finally David Mirza Ahmad on adversary resistant computing\nThe veteran investigative journalist says that: Electonic eavesdropping is not new.\u201d He explains how in the 1930\u2019s: The Supreme Court of the US was bugged by corporate America\u201d Here\u2019s a round-up of tweets reacting to Bergman\u2019s speech:\nLowell Bergman, who won the 2004 Pulitzer prize for public service and is the chair of investigative journalism at UC Berkeley, is now speaking. He says: Always report against your story \u2013 see it from each side. The reason why a story isn\u2019t picked up is if it hasn\u2019t received sufficient due diligence \u2013 and it hasn\u2019t persuaded the sceptics. Make sure you check your documents \u201cdocuments can lie\u201d Face to face is always best\nNext up is Dutch photojournalist Kadir van Lohuizen. He talks about his international projects - from Greenland to Bangladesh. The auditorium is shown images from the Bangladesh project, a country which faces rising sea-levels, glacial meltwater from the Himalayan mountains to its north, and a wall is being built between Bangladesh and India. Kadir asks where will the people go?\nHe has set up the Noor agency to cover stories visually, around the world.\nLewis says, as he outlines in his book 935 Lies, that the \u201cbiggest lies in US history that cost the most lives\u201d is actually the tobacco industry. He says presidents, whether it was Jimmy Carter or Barack Obama, have helped facilitate its trade. He adds that president Obama is spinning more than president Bush \u2013 there are fewer reporters in the White House now \u2013 and this is a worrying trend.\nCharles Lewis makes parallels between the coverage of Vietnam war and Iraq invasion:\nCharles Lewis is a Washington-based investigative journalist and is the founder of the Center for Public Integrity in the US.\nLewis is speaking about the invasion of Iraq and asks \u201cwhat if the public don\u2019t actually want to accept the truth?\u201d \u201cAs late as 2012 60% of republicans still think WMD were found in Iraq.\u201d He adds that\u2019s when he realised there was a crisis in journalism.\nThe auditorium is filling up again \u2013\nIn this session we\u2019ll hear from: Charles Lewis speaking \u201cOn truth\u201d Kadir van Lohuizen on visual investigations and Lowell Bergman speaking on multinational companies\nWelcome back to the liveblog! I\u2019m Aisha Gani, reporter on the Guardian\u2019s news desk and I\u2019ve been covering day 2 of the Logan Symposium \u2013 a conference on secrecy, surveillance and censorship. You can follow my tweets: @aishagani. The hashtag for the event is #LoganCIJ14. So far, we have covered whistleblowing and methods for investigation. We also had a special speech from Pentagon papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg.\nWe\u2019ve finished the morning sessions now, and I\u2019ll be back liveblogging at 14:00. A\nHere are some reactions on twitter to Daniel Ellsberg\u2019s speech:\nDaniel Ellsberg, Pentagon papers whistleblower, says: I identified very much with Chelsea Manning\u201d\nEllsberg says that three things matter when whistleblowing: It has to be in mass has to have documents timely He says that Britain\u2019s Katharine Gun is the only mass whisteblower who did it very timely, who leaked the tricks used during the UN Iraq war vote.\nDutch writer Karin Spaink is speaking about the mayhem and mishap of medical records in the Netherlands.\nSpaink speaks about a case of how a hacker was able to access medical records, and was able to change data. She said some computers were still using Windows \u201897. Some solutions include: Data hygiene Make data protected and encrypted medtronic pacemaker\nHere\u2019s a round-up of tweets on the Nicky Hager talk:\nNicky Hager is an investigative journalist from New Zealand, and is the next speaker. He says that the first thing police always look for in a search is your mobile phone. He suggests that journalists and IT people need to work together more on projects.\nSpeakers Anne Cadwallader and Paul O\u2019Connor speak about the case of Patrick Finucane, who was a practising lawyer who frequently acted for prominent members of the IRA, and was murdered in his home in North Belfast by the loyalist paramilitary group, the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) on the evening of 12 February 1989. Here\u2019s the official report of the Patrick Finucane Review. The report concluded that actions by employees of the State actively furthered and facilitated the murder of Patrick, and that in the aftermath there was relentless attempt to prevent justice and holding those responsible to account. The speakers explain how there is much evidence in the National Archives and in security leak sources.\nSo here\u2019s the panel for the \u201cmethods for investigation\u201d session, with special guest Daniel Ellsberg (centre), who leaked the Pentagon Papers to the New York Times strengthening public opposition to the Vietnam War in 1971.\nThe coffee break is over and next up is a session on investigation methods. Anne Cadwallader and Paul O\u2019Connor will talk about how \u201cthe truth is out there\u201d Nicky Hager will speak about working with whistleblowers. And Karin Spaink is to speak about medical records.\n\u201cThe best whistleblower is the one you don\u2019t know about\u201d, says Bea Edwards during the Q&A, and she explains that this shows organisations have protected the identity of the individual well.\nHere\u2019s a round up of tweets after the international defense of whistleblowers session:\nBea Edwards says that: If we didn\u2019t have whistleblowers in these various organisations we wouldn\u2019t no they were happening. Bea says that whistleblowers face incarceration and there are very few avenues for compensations or protection. She adds that it has been the press who have best protected Edward Snowden, or people like Ben-Artzi. Bea says we need credible non-governmental organisations working together, the press and the public and to not just address the crimes exposed but to protect the whistleblower \u2013 such as the Government Accountability Project in the US.\nBea gives the case study of Eric Ben-Artzi, former analyst at Deutsche Bank, who was black-listed for whistleblowing on international financial crimes. The Wall Street whistleblower wanted to know: How does national law enforcement investigate multinational banking fraud? Here are some tweets from the auditorium:\nBea Edwards, executive and international director of the US Government Accountability Project (GAP), which is the nation\u2019s leading whistleblower protection organisation, now provides the international defense of whistleblowers. Bea is responsible for the organisation\u2019s actions defending whistleblowers through the Congress, the media and the courts.\nWhistleblower Eileen Chubb gives her testimony of what happens after she whistleblowed on the UK healthcare system. Eileen says that: Your work place becomes a nightmare. The fear of tomorrow is there.\u201d \u201cThe trust of the employer is bing lost and that is very hard to compensate. Eileen says that if we don\u2019t protect the protectors, nothing will change, and adds that, next time, I wouldn\u2019t dial \u201cP\u201d for police, but I\u2019d dial \u201cP\u201d for Panorama.\u201d You can read more of her story here.\nGood morning! Aisha Gani here liveblogging day two of The Logan Symposium, a gathering in London of journalists, hacktivists, legal and security experts and artists to discuss topics including secrecy, surveillance and censorship. It\u2019s organised by charity the Centre for Investigative Journalism and Goldsmiths, University of London. Over its three days, the event will host speakers including Seymour Hersh, Laura Poitras, John Pilger, Sarah Harrison, Julian Assange, Annie Machon and Jacob Applebaum. The Guardian will be covering each day of the conference, starting with today\u2019s lineup of talks covering journalism; surveillance systems; the Edward Snowden revelations and other leaks; and the past and future of hacking. Expect updates throughout the day of the key points made by speakers, as well as links to any longer reports on the individual sessions. Follow my tweets and vines at @aishagani\n", "title": "Live from The Logan Symposium: secrecy, surveillance and censorship"}, {"date": "2014-12-05T19:17:24Z", "body": "Finally, a roll call of \u201cpersecuted journalists and hackers\u201d read by actor Francis Magee to finish off the day, and remind the audience that some of the people who couldn\u2019t attend this event are facing the greatest risks. Apologies, a Vine is just a six-second snapshot from a long, long list. But it\u2019s a fitting way to bring the day to a close.\nHarrison is asked about getting these messages across to the general public. \u201cJust education, and keeping on that. I\u2019ve had conversations with some people, it was actually a revelation that the internet is physically carried by cables across the world! In this age of Wi-Fi, people just think the internet is something magically in the air.\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting being in Germany whilst these revelations are coming out, there\u2019s still in living memory the history of surveillance here that was in a much more physical way. There\u2019s a bit more of an understanding here that even if you can\u2019t see it, the concept of this surveillance, the taking away of our rights, is hugely problematic... It\u2019s important not to give up.\u201d\nHarrison says one good outcome from the NSA revelations has been more journalists understanding encryption technology \u2013 or if not understanding it yet, being open for the need for it \u2013 which she says makes it easier for WikiLeaks to work with them. \u201cNow it\u2019s quite easy when I say we\u2019ll have to train you in some encryption methods, most journalists are actually quite pleased to have that training,\u201d she says. \u201cThe NSA revelations haven\u2019t necessarily made a large impact on how we\u2019ve had to work ourselves,\u201d she adds. \u201cPeople do get now that people like Julian and Jake [Jacob Appelbaum] are not actually paranoid, they\u2019re just correct, which is nice.\u201d Could things get worse on the surveillance front? \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that all is necessarily lost. Encryption does work. People do need to be trained to understand the technologies so they can protect themselves... It really is up to the technical community to help all members of the public find ways to protect themselves.\u201d\nHarrison has some advice for journalists, suggesting that they can follow Glenn Greenwald\u2019s recent career path: \u201cDo the work that you see as correct... and if you feel at any point that you\u2019re being prevented... your pieces are being too editorialised, or you want to publish a piece that the media organisation doesn\u2019t have the guts for, you should not only go it alone, but make some noise about it... make sure the public knows that the information is being filtered.\u201d\nHarrison is asked about the crackdown on press freedom being matched by a less-reported \u201ccivil rights crackdown\u201d on the Muslim community by one audience member. Is that something she has views on? \u201cI completely see what you\u2019re referring to. One of the biggest issues is this: the government in the UK and the US as well, they like to use the rhetoric of national security, terrorism etc, basically as propaganda tools to give them the cover to operate in all sorts of abusive ways,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is questioned enough. If you look at the statements that the US government said about us when we released the Iraq war logs and Afghan war logs, they tried to say we had blood on our hands. Which is quite extraordinary when we\u2019re exposing the tens of thousands of deaths at the hands of the US... This is all done under this guise of national security, and it\u2019s really created problems within the UK and US communities and media on how to deal with Muslim communities, and to understand that it\u2019s not okay for anybody\u2019s rights to be broken... The press in the UK really needs to grow some balls for the most part.\u201d\nShe talks about the Courage Foundation, which spawned from WikiLeaks\u2019 involvement in helping Edward Snowden travel from Hong Kong to Moscow. \u201cWe saw that there was a need, and hence we started up Courage, which basically is a whistleblower support organisation. The unique part about Courage is it\u2019s not only global, but it\u2019s being set up specifically for these high-risk cases to help in some of the most dangerous circumstances of whistleblowers to get them the help that they need.\u201d But then it\u2019s questions from the audience. First, John Pilger\u2019s earlier speech about WikiLeaks being airbrushed out of the story of recent leaks in comparison to Snowden and Greenwald. \u201cI think that there has been a lot of, and I don\u2019t really see it as particularly helpful or correct, people like to try and draw these comparisons. Who\u2019s better or who\u2019s achieved more?\u201d she says. \u201cIf you look at the case of Snowden and Assange, they\u2019re completely different beings. Edward Snowden is a whistleblower, Julian Assange is a journalist and a publisher. Snowden did a heroic act, and Julian\u2019s life work \u2013 starting of WikiLeaks and also the work he did before then \u2013 shows great bravery. People who draw these comparisons, it\u2019s about maybe their own misgivings, or they\u2019re playing into the government rhetoric too much.\u201d\nThe last speaker at The Logan Symposium is WikiLeaks journalist Sarah Harrison, who is also acting director of the Courage Foundation, which raises money for the legal and public defence of journalistic sources. She\u2019s now based in Berlin, and like Laura Poitras has been advised not to travel to the UK for legal reasons, so is Skypeing in her session. \u201cThe UK is having what I think is a large crackdown on press freedoms. It\u2019s under the Terrorism Act that the intelligence services went into the Guardian\u2019s offices... it\u2019s what they used to detain David Miranda, and it\u2019s the reason my lawyers have advised me not to go home,\u201d she says, calling for a campaign in the UK to demand that journalists not be muzzled by legislation intended for terrorists.\nFinally, what has she learned in all her work about the consequences of what the NSA and GCHQ are doing? \u201cI do think that in a strange way, being put on a watch list made me a bit resilient, and ready to handle the story,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd Snowden learned from other whistleblowers... I think that\u2019s partly the good news. That people are willing to take risks to expose injustice or wrongdoing.\u201d\nAnother question: the harshest reactions to the Snowden revelations seem to have come from the UK rather than the US \u2013 the detainment of Glenn Greenwald\u2019s partner during an airport transfer, for example, and that hard-drive destroying Guardian incident. Why? \u201cYour analysis is clearly right... certainly the response has been the most anti-free-press, and really attacking the reporting in a way that we haven\u2019t seen on the same level in the US,\u201d she says, but declines to suggest why. \u201cPerhaps someone in the room who is from the UK can answer that one.\u201d Finally, she\u2019s asked about how she keeps the raw material for her films safe, after it\u2019s been shot. When she flew to Hong Kong she had multiple, encrypted hard drives, and giving them to a local contact so they weren\u2019t stored in her hotel room. \u201cI was very concerned that we could be raided, and that everything could be taken. I had everything backed up \u2013 I\u2019m religious about backing up, it\u2019s essential \u2013 and the film I shot there\u2019s one copy in Hong Kong, and I travelled with the other.\u201d\nShe\u2019s asked about how she conveys \u201cempowerment through technology\u201d to her fellow journalists. \u201cOne of the effects of this story is probably a lot more journalists have learned to use encryption, because they care about source protection \u2013 which I hope they do! \u2013 but also to be prepared if they ever get a knock on the door.\u201d She admits that it can be difficult to get some of the tools required for her work \u2013 video editing, for example \u2013 that are free [secure] software. \u201cAt some point it becomes a case of what is your threat model versus what you want to accomplish. When it comes to protecting sources, we have an obligation to use technology that we believe to be secure,\u201d she says, before addressing hackers directly: \u201cThe challenge is on you right now to build tools that people like me can use. Although I did figure out how to get Tails running, it wasn\u2019t easy: there was a learning curve. I had enough information to know that it was essential, but not every journalist does. So it\u2019s important that we focus on building tools that are easy to use, and which don\u2019t require such a steep learning curve.\u201d Something Seymour Hersh also talked about earlier in the day.\nQuestions from the audience: one about the difference between the Guardian and the Washington Post, in their treatment of the Snowden leaks. She talks about her personal (and just as importantly, encrypted) connection with Bart Gellman from the Washington Post, which is why one story was given to him. She talks about the effort she put into getting Glenn Greenwald, then of the Guardian, onto an encrypted connection, and then to meet her in New York ready to work on the story. \u201cThe Post were going to go, and then they pulled out, and I was in this kind of limbo phase, when I couldn\u2019t reach Glenn with encryption, and the Post had pulled out, and the Post\u2019s lawyers were advising me not to go,\u201d she says. But as soon as Greenwald got on an encrypted connection and heard Poitras\u2019 story, he \u201cjumped straight on a plane and we went to Hong Kong.\u201d\nWhat has this all been like for Poitras personally, and what is her life like in Berlin? \u201cOn the one hand, this has definitely been the scariest film I\u2019ve ever made. I\u2019m very aware of angering people who are really powerful, who operate in the shadows. I\u2019ve felt a lot of fear working on this film,\u201d she says. \u201cOn the other hand, being in Berlin has been absolutely extraordinary... it\u2019s been a joy. It\u2019s a coming together of people who are willing to take risks, and form a community. And that\u2019s a great thing.\u201d\nWhy did Poitras share this story with journalist Glenn Greenwald, when she could have kept it to herself and bagged all the glory, wonders moderator Laura Flanders. She says it\u2019s because she defines herself as a filmmaker \u2013 a visual storyteller. \u201cThis was clearly a print story. And it wasn\u2019t just one journalist\u2019s print story, it was a big story,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s partly because I didn\u2019t move up from a print newsroom background, so I didn\u2019t feel proprietary relationship to breaking stories... I certainly felt an obligation to getting the information out, and for the security of the material.\u201d More on those suspicions of entrapment: Poitras talks about the story of Sabu, the Lulzsec leader who became an FBI informant, and says this is the environment she was working in. She even asked Snowden that: \u201cHow do I know you\u2019re not crazy? How do I know you\u2019re not trying to entrap me?\u201d His reply: \u201cYou\u2019ll know that I\u2019m not trying to entrap you because I\u2019m not going to be asking anything of you.\u201d Poitras adds that \u201che appreciated my paranoia.\u201d\nPoitras talks about her conversations with various media organisations in the run-up to meeting Snowden in Hong Kong. \u201cOne thing I\u2019d like to stress in all of this, I think in retrospect, journalists and media organisations think of this as a big story that any news organisation would wanna get, but in truth there was a lot of fear in these organisations. And the Washington Post decided in the end not to send Bart Gellman, because they were worried about some of the risks.\u201d She says there was also nervousness within the Guardian. \u201cThe decision to publish this information didn\u2019t come without some risk-taking from a lot of people.\u201d She is asked about her comment about a \u201cfreak out\u201d in Hong Kong by a newspaper organisation, referred to earlier in the day. \u201cThe Guardian, because it was the US intelligence agency that they were reporting on, maybe felt that it was less risky for them,\u201d she says. But as GCHQ came into the story, she says that \u201cwhen some of those documents made it to London, they had a bit of a freak-out... and there was a person who came to Hong Kong to help us with some technical things was instructed to destroy some material. But nothing was lost.\u201d\nA liveblogger\u2019s eye view of a Skyped-in keynote:\nNext up is documentary-maker Laura Poitras, beaming in via Skype to talk about her work with NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, including details of how she communicated with him, and some details of working with the press. She corresponded with Snowden over the course of five months using encryption technology, including the Tails operating system, which Poitras hadn\u2019t used before. The person who set it up for her asked \u201cwho\u2019s your adversary\u201d, and when being told it was the NSA, replied \u201cOh, that\u2019s quite a serious adversary!\u201d \u2013 this drew a laugh from the audience. Poitras says she had a gut feeling early on in her communications with Snowden that he was a legitimate source with information to reveal that would have a great impact. \u201cI was very concerned or cautious about the risk of there being potentially some kind of entrapment. And that wasn\u2019t an unfounded risk,\u201d she says. \u201cI was very cautious to make sure there was nothing suspicious about our communication, because I was very aware it could be an elaborate entrapment attempt.\u201d\nSo, Fix has some suggestions on how hackers can keep their value system from deteriorating. One rule: \u201cLet us begin to appraise hacks no longer by their technical brilliance alone, but also by their usefulness to make the world a better place,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd us means everybody, not just hackers. In fact, especially not hackers... I would love people everywhere talking about the usefulness of a hack, as much as they do its technical details.\u201d Fix updates Karl Marx\u2019s famous \u201creligion is the opium of the people\u201d quote (well, a paraphrasing). \u201cInternet is opium for the people. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love the internet, I am convinced it can take an important role in the transformation of societies,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the internet has one downside: people often use it as an escape from reality. Much cheaper than drugs too... It can lift the burden of caring for the real world... Who cares about the total surveillance that comes with it over the same cables? Well, we do.\u201d Fix wants hackers to act. \u201cNothing is more important than to get things done,\u201d he says. \u201cOnly ask yourself is what you are doing legitimate. Don\u2019t care about legality... And therefore we have to consider everything political. There is no escape from that. The time for the playfulness that was mentioned earlier? I think it is gone... This is about our future. Let us start hacking it.\u201d\nFinally, in this session, Bernd Fix \u2013 a German hacker and security expert \u2013 to talk about the future of hacking. But he started with its history: famous hacks by the Chaos Computer Club, warning the audience not to be taken in by the legends that have sprung up around them. \u201cBut we as hackers did something right in the past... our aim was never the information society. What we struggled for was the informed society,\u201d he says. \u201cWe should carry that into the future, and not all these fancy hacks that we talk about.\u201d He compares the fascinating with hackers by \u201cthe establishment\u201d today to that shown towards foreigners as \u201cnoble savages\u201d centuries ago, and warns of fragmentation and hierarchy among the current hacking community, which he worries are \u201cneglecting solidarity with our own kind... but even worse is the influence of commercialisation.\u201d How so? \u201cBelieve it or not, there are so-called hackers with software patents. That\u2019s like a non-smoker with a cigar! For me, that\u2019s completely crazy. They start releasing software just as open source, but not as free software. And they think it\u2019s fine to use Apple hardware ad Faceboogle [sic] services, and even worse, some think it\u2019s okay to work for such companies!\u201d\nNext up: an academic history of \u201chacking Europe\u201d by Ruth Oldenziel from Eindhoven University of Technology and Gerard Alberts from the University of Amsterdam, based on their book of the same name. Alberts\u2019 section of the presentation focuses on \u201cthe playfulness of hacking culture\u201d in Europe, during the Cold War. \u201cPlay was a quintessential element to the culture of personal computing... hackers were the first to create the space to play in,\u201d he says. Oldenziel adds that the context of this play is very important, talking about the scene in 1989 a few months before the Berlin Wall came down, and criticising the \u201cUS-centric\u201d story about how the internet came about. She talked about the role hackers played in the 1980s in Europe \u201cfilling the void\u201d left by companies like IBM, who she suggests weren\u2019t interested in Europe. She talks about engineers tinkering with computers in Yugoslavia in 1983; the Greek computing community getting together in a football stadium in 1987; and the Computer Bus Dutch Housewives Association in 1985 \u2013 a photo of what looks like a bus full of older Dutch women learning to use computers is shown at this point \u2013 as well as the rise of hacker culture in Amsterdam between 1989 and 1993. Oldenziel talks about Amsterdam hackers\u2019 desire to rethink the internet as \u201ca public place... a public square. We had a huge hacker culture that was on a par with the British\u201d. And finally, she talks about the Czech RONJA community in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with its DIY wireless device that people could build themselves to get connected.\nHow many conferences mix a play in with the panel sessions? This one does. Wau-Pengo 1989 is based on the transcript of an encounter between a hacker caught spying for the KGB, and the founder of the hacking club who felt betrayed by his actions.\nOne quick additional comment from Ross Anderson, who was asked about Facebook-owned messaging app WhatsApp recently introducing encryption. \u201cThe reaction of the tech industry to Snowden has been helpful,\u201d says Anderson, who also describes Google\u2019s engineers as \u201chitting the roof\u201d at some of the Snowden revelations of backdoor access by the NSA. \u201cThere\u2019s a determination to see to it that the spooks only get stuff through the front door. The WhatsApp decision is part of it, as is the Apple move to encrypt the iPhone, as is Facebook becoming available through Tor.\u201d He talks about attempts by GCHQ in the UK to \u201cbully\u201d Facebook into making information available to the authorities. \u201cIf I were Mark Zuckerberg, the only rational reques to that would be for in the future, every request from GCHQ to go through our lawyers. And that will take six months.\u201d\nDuring the break, I wanted to come back to the talk just after John Pilger from Olia Lialina, an author, net artist and \u201canimated GIF model\u201d who talked about the digital art she\u2019s making around topics such as censorship and technology access. One of her projects is an archive of GeoCities websites, from the early days of mainstream access to the web. \u201cIt is supposed to be the most bad-taste of online productions,\u201d she said. \u201cBut these are not just funny pages made by amateurs. This is a tradition of working online where you are completely controlling the presentation, the look of what you do. It is a time that should be very dear for us... a lot of choices and decisions were made by users, not by the developers.\u201d Lialina also talked about language, and the move within the online design world to talk less about \u201cusers\u201d and more about \u201cpeople\u201d \u2013 something she\u2019s not a fan of. She showed a poster from Facebook\u2019s headquarters with the word \u201cusers\u201d crossed out in favour of \u201cpeople\u201d. \u201cDo you think people from Facebook see you as [more of] a real person, because they have it on the poster?\u201d she asked. \u201cUser is not somebody who is dumb. It can be somebody who didn\u2019t write the program, but it can be somebody that did.\u201d Lialina also talked about civil rights beyond privacy: \u201cthe right to log out\u201d and \u201cthe right to undo\u201d, which she sees as being eroded by modern internet services and devices like smartphones.\nFinally, the environment. Anderson talked about news sites being encrypted, so it\u2019s not obvious who read what, and it also makes targeted censorship harder: \u201cIran must block it all, or not at all,\u201d he says, by way of example. \u201cAnd as more and more people encrypt their website the choke point for most investigators \u2013 those without NSA-level powers \u2013 have to move through mutual legal assistance,\u201d he says. Which is a slower process. His conclusion: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to build special systems to support investigative journalism, any more than gumshoes need special hotels or cars. It makes you stick out a mile... Remember this phrase: anonymity loves company.\u201d He warns that journalists can\u2019t just set a policy and technology and stick to it: they have to keep reassessing it in response to \u201cwhat the spooks actually do\u201d. Which, Anderson noted, comes back down to tradecraft.\nAnderson says that \u201cmany nuggets of information themselves are highly disclosive\u201d, citing medical records as an example where even \u201canonymised\u201d data can be surprisingly rich, when queried in detail. \u201cShow me the medical records of all 48 year-old women with a nine year-old daughter both of whom have psoriasis\u201d. \u201cIf somebody at Whitehall leaks you some stuff, even if you use the most stringent security measures, you\u2019ve got to think really hard about whether you\u2019re going to burn your source,\u201d he says, moving on to tradecraft. 20 years ago, a journalist would try not to compromise their sources by having a way for sources to \u201cwalk in\u201d; meet them somewhere innocuous; make sure they weren\u2019t being followed; and would try not to use phones that might be tapped. And now, in the internet era? He says the main source of tradecraft is common sense, then a study of cases where the authorities have made a real effort to get access to data on sources. But also now the Snowden revelations, which he sees as a valuable source of information on how to protect journalistic sources from NSA snooping.\nThe next speaker is Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, talking about the systems that investigative journalists need post-Snowden, analysed at three levels: the science and engineering, the tradecraft and the environment. On the first of those: he cited some of the problems of public key cryptography: man-in-the-middle attacks where \u201cthe NSA guy pretends to be you to your source, and pretends to you that he\u2019s your source\u201d, and also the fact that \u201cif you\u2019re the only guy in Burma using PGP, you\u2019re going to be conspicuous!\u201d Anderson talks about anonymous technology Tor, and the fact that it \u201csucks\u201d for GCHQ, but he warns that it\u2019s not a solution everywhere \u2013 countries like China and Iran try to block it \u2013 and that it has some other limitations. \u201cAnonymity loves company: you can only hide in a crowd,\u201d he notes. So some systems for secure communication don\u2019t have enough users for general-purpose use. \u201cThe fact that you\u2019ve got it on your phone is a dead giveaway.\u201d Anderson says mass market tools like Skype and Gmail can be surprisingly good instead \u201cif we get the tradecraft right\u201d. Anderson talks about censorship-resistant systems, including filesharing clients. Why them? \u201cAs Snowden tells us, the NSA throws all this stuff away... they take all the peer-to-peer stuff and they throw it in the bin bucket. There\u2019s too much of it. Does that give anybody ideas?\u201d\nHis fifth point: the technical complexity of reporting on leaks like the Snowden documents. It may make sense for journalists to focus on stories that are easier to understand for a mainstream audience, in this case, rather than the more complex aspects that need deep technical knowledge to understand. Sixth: overcoming abstraction: in Germany, Angela Merkel\u2019s phone calls being listened to caused a huge stir, but the monitoring of online activity by 80 million citizens was comparably uncontroversial. M\u00fcller-Maguhn says it\u2019s key to make people understand the impact of global surveillance operations for their life, economy and country. And he wants more people to understand that \u201ccrypto and operational security can help you\u201d is also important. And finally, M\u00fcller-Maguhn talks about dealing with journalists in situations of confrontation: having to go to confront agencies like the NSA when a story is being worked on. And he warns of human aspects: some journalists might not want to \u201cbe rude to an NSA guy\u201d who they see as a valuable contact. He also criticises the idea of \u201cbalanced reporting\u201d as an obstacle in some cases. \u201cIf we\u2019d had this in Germany: \u2018Oh, shouldn\u2019t we ask the Nazis, and have a statement from them on the killing of the Jews? We have to make balanced reporting right?\u2019... If we\u2019re talking about massive violation of human rights worldwide, I\u2019m not sure if this is a great point to discuss.\u201d\nSo, that criticism for journalists. What \u201cspecific media mechanisms, limitations and implications\u201d does he see in the Snowden leaked documents process? The first is titled simply \u201cshitting in the pants\u201d. What? He refers to the claim by Laura Poitras that one British newspaper had a \u201cfreak out\u201d and started destroying some of the Snowden documents. The second: legal considerations of the main actors. Snowden handed his materials to two American journalists, which in turn brought them to the attention of US lawyers, with some specific restrictions over how that material could then be used and distributed. \u201cThe judgement of what is public interest becomes the key of the whole thing: if the US audience and the US judge think it was not public interest, then from an American legal point of view, you\u2019re fucked.\u201d His third point: that question of public interest. \u201cWhich audience are we talking about?\u201d says M\u00fcller-Maguhn. The public interest for the Chinese population would be different to the US population, perhaps. \u201cWe de-prioritise the human rights of non-American people,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s sad to see that kind of attitude goes into this kind of publication process.\u201d Fourth: the perception of \u201clegitimate action by the NSA\u201d and whether reporters would have \u201cblood on their hands\u201d for publishing the leaked documents. The publication process has often been about this question: \u201cThe narrative of terrorism. The narrative of criminal activity... If we look at the war on drugs, the war on this, the war on that, the question of legitimate activity is a complex one, and also a political one I would say.\u201d And this is why Snowden deliberately handed that decision over to the journalists that he worked with. On the blood-on-the-hands theory: is there more blood on the hands of journalists and whistleblowers if they do publish, and intelligence agents suffer, or if they don\u2019t publish, and activities their agencies are carrying out \u2013 M\u00fcller-Maguhn cites drone strikes on individuals \u2013 continue. \u201cWe are in the shit anyhow. It\u2019s just a question of the depth of the shit that we\u2019re in!\u201d\nAndy M\u00fcller-Maguhn of the German Chaos Computer Club is the next speaker \u2013 I\u2019ve missed one, Olia Lialina, but will come back to the tablet notes on her talk in a bit. M\u00fcller-Maguhn is talking about \u201cworking with the Snowden revelations\u201d, and is promising some more criticism for journalists. But he starts by talking about a project called Treasuremap, which aims to build \u201ca near real-time, interactive map of the global internet\u201d tracking people and devices \u2013 and what it means in the context of the NSA structure, and the structure of that agency within the US government. It\u2019s a presentation that\u2019s perhaps more understandable for a hacker or an expert on the NSA\u2019s structure, just to warn you. But M\u00fcller-Maguhn moves on to how the data collected by the NSA is being used, using terminology from the east German Stasi \u2013 \u201cKompromat\u201d \u2013 roughly translated as \u201cthat stuff you don\u2019t want to have public\u201d for any citizen. If the authorities get that data, they can change your behaviour. He cites an example talked about by Snowden: CIA operatives trying to recruit a Swiss banker by getting him drunk, encouraging him to drive home, and then offering to help when he got arrested for drunk-driving.\nThe liveblog entries may dry up in about 20 minutes by the way. Not for \u201chandmaiden of suppression\u201d reasons, but for \u201claptop battery life of 24%\u201d reasons. Will be switching to a tablet and collaborating with AutoCorrect to take notes and quotes that will be posted later. Update: I\u2019ve found the overspill room with plug sockets. #technology\nPilger finishes off by talking about WikiLeaks, suggesting that the organisation and its founder Julian Assange has not got the credit or support that it is due. \u201cPeople have made big money while WikiLeaks has struggled to survive,\u201d says Pilger, attacking the Guardian, again, over the recent Swedish Right Livelihood award which was won by Edward Snowden, with Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger also one of the recipients. \u201cAssange and WikiLeaks were airbrushed. They didn\u2019t exist. They were un-people. No one spoke up for the man who pioneered digital whistleblowing, and handed the Guardian one of the biggest scoops in its history.\u201d\n\u201cIn the news, whole countries are made to disappear,\u201d says Pilger, suggesting that coverage of countries including Saudi Arabia and the Yemen is lacking, as well as developments in Latin America \u2013 Hugo Chavez\u2019s Venezuela in particular, where he claims the same three publications\u2019 reports have been \u201croutine in their bad faith\u201d. Then Pilger moves on to news in the UK. \u201cWhy are millions of people in Britain convinced that a collective punishment known as austerity is necessary?\u201d he says, harking back to the last financial crash. \u201cFor a split second, the banks were lined up as crooks with obligations to the public they\u2019d betrayed, but within a few months... the message changed,\u201d says Pilger. \u201cThe mugshots of guilty bankers vanished from the tabloids, and something called austerity became the burden of millions of ordinary people. Was there ever a sleight of hand so brazen?... The economic crisis is pure propaganda. It\u2019s a transfer of wealth from the bottom to the top. But who\u2019s standing up for the majority?\u201d\n\u201cThe handmaidens of suppression, of fake objectivity, had done their job well,\u201d says Pilger, about the media\u2019s coverage of the war in Iraq. \u201cThe trail of blood that goes from Iraq to London has almost been scrubbed clean.\u201d He talks about the power of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s newspapers and TV networks, but suggests that \u201cthe influence of Murdoch\u2019s empire is no greater than its reflection of the wider media. The most effective propaganda is often not found in Murdoch\u2019s Sun or Fox News, but beneath a liberal halo.\u201d He points to the New York Times, the Washington Post and the Guardian. \u201cBoth of which have played a critical role in conditioning their readers to accept a new and dangerous cold war\u201d \u2013 referring to the current situation in Ukraine, which Pilger criticises these three newspapers for \u201cmisrepresenting\u201d as a malign campaign by Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Pilger says he also sees coverage of the crash of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 as a situation where \u201cagain, supposedly liberal media are the most convincing censors... Sometimes it feels like a class reunion. The drum-beaters of the Washington Post beating the drum for isolating Russia are the very same editorial writers who quoted the facts about Saddam Hussein\u2019s weapons of mass destruction to be \u2013 quote \u2013 hard fact.\u201d\n\u201cPropaganda is no longer an invisible government. It is the government,\u201d continues Pilger. \u201cThe information age that we refer to, in my opinion is principally a media age. We have war by media, censorship by media, retribution by media, demonology by media, diversion by media. A surreal assembly line of obedient cliches and false assumptions.\u201d Pilger talks about the possibility that if journalists in a free press had \u201cdone their job\u201d, the US and UK might not have gone to war in Iraq, and says that\u2019s backed up by his conversations with various mainstream journalists. \u201cHad journalists done their job: had they questioned and investigated the propaganda instead of amplifying it, hundreds of thousands of men, women and children might be alive today, and millions might not have fled their homes... and the infamous Islamic State might not now exist.\u201d\nThe first speaker in the afternoon session is journalist John Pilger, who\u2019s going to talk about \u201cjournalist as a craft, regardless of the means and regardless of the obstacles\u201d. He kicks off with some questions. \u201cWhy has so much journalism succumbed to propaganda? Why are censorship and distortion within the media almost standard practice? Why do great newspapers like the New York Times and the Washington Post deceive their readers?\u201d And he asks why young journalists aren\u2019t taught to analyse media agendas, and decode what they read and see in the mainstream media: \u201cnot information, but power\u201d.\nBy the way, here\u2019s a standalone piece on the Seymour Hersh keynote, rounding up all those zingers. The conference is breaking for lunch, but I\u2019ll be back with more updates from 2pm-ish.\n\u201cIn India right now, there is currently no privacy legislation. They are building all these surveillance systems, yet there is no law which can protect citizens,\u201d says Xynou. There is a draft privacy bill under discussion in 2014, though. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s not perfect... but still I think it\u2019s definitely a very good first step.\u201d \u201cBut the main problem in India is a lot of these programs are carried out in secret. There\u2019s no transparency whatsoever,\u201d she finishes.\u201dIn order for us to be able to increase transparency in what\u2019s going on in the biggest democracy in terms of population in the world, we definitely need people to leak more documents.\u201d\nXynou has studied 50 companies who sell a range of technologies used for surveillance in India. She talks about some, including Kommlabs, which \u201clooks out for cognitive and emotional stress in voice calls, then flags them\u201d. She also talks about the National Intelligence Grid (NATGRID) which links up various national databases of personal information in India, from vehicle registrations and mobile phone logs to bank account details, train reservations and passport data. Linking these databases for a billion people risks errors, says Xynou. \u201cThe probability of errors is extremely high. And the main problem is there is no regulation behind this: no system of checks and balances to see if breaches can occur,\u201d she said, before drawing attention to the UID biometric data collection scheme that recently launched in India. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge debate in India whether this violates privacy or not,\u201d she says. For example, some contractors involved in providing devices and infrastructure for the scheme have ties to US intelligence agencies, which may be \u201cproblematic\u201d for privacy to say the least.\nNext to speak is Maria Xynou, a privacy and surveillance researcher at the Tactical Technology Collective in Berlin. She\u2019s talking about surveillance in India. \u201cThe majority of the population lives in rural areas and in really bad conditions. Often I feel that marginalised people on the margins of society are the guinea pigs for surveillance. It often affects them first,\u201d she says. Indian mobile operators are required to install lawful intercept and monitoring (LIM) systems to use on request from law enforcement authorities, but Xynou notes that the Indian government has its own system too, monitoring traffic through ISPs. The Network Traffic Analysis (NETRA) system only came to light in 2013. \u201cEssentially what it does: it intercepts and monitors almost all internet communications [looking for] suspicious words and suspicious phrases,\u201d she says. And for anyone considering encryption as a way around this: \u201cIf authorities in India ask you to disclose your private encryption keys, you have to.\u201d\nThat document the NSA was so keen to get hold of? It\u2019s here today! Duncan Campbell has hidden a copy under Bamford\u2019s chair, which gets a big laugh from the audience.\n\u201cI have a great deal of respect for whistleblowers,\u201d says Bamford. \u201cI have a lot of admiration for their courage.\u201d He spent three days in Moscow with Edward Snowden last year, to write a profile piece for Wired. \u201cThe key thing for him was encryption. And the key thing for most people these days becoming whistleblowers, they have to trust the person they\u2019re gonna deal with... the more we get involved in encryption, the better it is,\u201d he says, before returning to the theme of the NSA\u2019s capabilities. \u201cThis is an agency that has this enormous capability to eavesdrop on everybody. And Ed Snowden for a year is taking what the NSA says is 1.7 million documents out, and they didn\u2019t even know about it until he announced it.\u201d Bamford calls for a new Justice Department investigation into the NSA focusing on lawbreakers within government, like one that followed the Rockefeller Report in 1975 \u2013 which he wrote about in a recent article, including threats from the current-day NSA if he published its details. \u201cThey can have the Justice Department begin a criminal investigation of the NSA. There\u2019s a precedent for it. Instead of putting whistleblowers in jail, we should be prosecuting the people committing crimes who are in the government,\u201d he says.\nBamford is talking about how President Nixon got the NSA to eavesdrop on celebrities: Jane Fonda, Dr. Benjamin Spock and Muhammad Ali, for example. Then he moves on to Senator Frank Church and his Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in 1975, which was one of the first such committees to study the NSA\u2019s capabilities and activities. Bamford also talks about his personal history, working for two weeks of active duty in the Navy Reserve at an NSA facility, and his growing realisation that the agency may have been violating the law by eavesdropping on Americans, not just foreign nationals. Bamford turned whistleblower for the Church Committee. \u201cThe NSA had told them they\u2019d stopped a year earlier. Well, I said \u2018I\u2019ve just been down there, and I know English when I hear it!\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were eavesdropping on Americans and that made Frank Church very angry. They lied. Before that I didn\u2019t know government actually lied. Nobody told me that!\u201d\nNext up: journalist and documentary maker James Bamford to talk about the NSA. \u201cI appreciate following Duncan. All I\u2019ve done in my life is follow Duncan!\u201d he says, graciously. Bamford\u2019s first book about the NSA came out two years before Edward Snowden was even born, so he\u2019s giving another veteran\u2019s perspective on surveillance. \u201cThis didn\u2019t just happen a week ago or a year ago when Snowden came out. It\u2019s been going on a long time, and that\u2019s one of the problems,\u201d says Bamford. He notes that it\u2019s the only agency in the US that wasn\u2019t created through the usual process of Congress \u2013 it was the creation of President Truman in 1952. \u201cCongress wasn\u2019t even notified about it. Even its name was top secret!\u201d he says, noting that it was also created \u201coutside of normal laws... NSA doesn\u2019t have to follow any other rules unless NSA is specifically mentioned.\u201d For example, if a president says \u201call domestic agencies must cease domestic eavesdropping\u201d, the NSA would not be included in that. Bamford suggests that the Snowden revelations have since showed \u201cwhat happens when you have a totally secret agency and you let them operate without any laws.\u201d\n\u201cAll sorts of countries have been co-opted,\u201d says Campbell. Denmark, Spain, Sweden \u2013 \u201chugely important\u201d \u2013 and he shows a map of a \u201cmassive, global, integrated system with third parties playing a major role in feeding in just what NSA wants\u201d. He says the story about the NSA subverting the internet \u2013 \u201ca story that is starting to flood out\u201d \u2013 is going to be much more prominent in the coming years, and compares this to what\u2019s happening with ECHELON. \u201cEven in the face of this massively expanding empire of surveillance, they want to collect it all,\u201d he continues. \u201cThis is also true of the ECHELON program... The greed to take all our data has no end. But it never had. You saw it in the sixties.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a fascinating talk, going back to 1970, when Campbell says \u201cAmerican money paid for the equipment\u201d to be used for ECHELON. \u201cThis was driven, at the height of the Cold War, a project of equal priority, to spy on the population of the United States, United Kingdom and western Europe,\u201d says Campbell, who promises a big feature on this to be published imminently on The Intercept. \u201cSo many people turned it into the Panopticon that does everything... It doesn\u2019t access television cameras, it doesn\u2019t sneak into your house. It doesn\u2019t do many of the things you may read in the looser articles,\u201d he says, stressing the specific use for ECHELON. \u201cIt intercepts communication satellites.\u201d Campbell recommends a book by Nicky Hager outlining New Zealand\u2019s role in ECHELON, putting the program into perspective. \u201cThe template for what we now see on a scale of... I don\u2019t know, a billion times larger? A thousand billion times larger?\u201d\nThe next speaker at the conference is another investigative journalist, Duncan Campbell, talking about revelations of surveillance long before Edward Snowden. Back to 1976, in fact, and his articles about the Menwith Hill Station eavesdropping base. He\u2019s talking about a 1980 investigation that was commissioned by the Sunday Times, but was then blocked. \u201cWe\u2019ve flushed out what we think was the real way that story was blocked, and hopefully we\u2019ll have that story within a week,\u201d he says. But the main subject of his talk is ECHELON, the \u201cglobal electronic spy system\u201d that he first reported on in 1988 in the New Statesman, which he says the more recent Snowden revelations have backed up. \u201cWe got it right!\u201d he says.\nHersh on the NSA again: \u201cSnowden shook up the community, big-time. How many Snowdens are there, they don\u2019t know? They worry about it, because they\u2019re very, very sloppy\u2026 They don\u2019t even know what they\u2019ve done wrong. They can\u2019t find out,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely dysfunctional place. And I think we can\u2019t get to it because of secrecy\u2026 It\u2019s an agency that needs to be cleaned up. It\u2019s a menace to itself because they\u2019re incompetent, but if somebody competent got in there\u2026\u201d And he finishes off with a rousing call to fellow journalists on their role in holding power to account. \u201cWe are here to keep them in check, to keep the powers that be in check. That\u2019s the only thing between them, and chaos \u2013 fascism if you like. Because they lie. They are frigging liars, because it\u2019s so easy to lie,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have a role to play. We can at least keep them afraid of us.\u201d\nHersh has a message for encryption experts, calling for them to continue working with journalists \u2013 especially those whose technology skills may not be top-tier. \u201cYou guys who know an awful lot about computers, you have to do more for the dummies! You aren\u2019t doing enough for the dummies\u2026 I know you all think encryption is easy, but it\u2019s not for a lot of people\u2026 When I have trouble with my computer, I wait for some 10 year-old kid to walk by! There has to be some way to really get it going...\u201d But he also says that being a \u201cdummy\u201d remains important in protecting his sources. \u201cI don\u2019t put anything into a computer, and I like it that way. You pick up my iPhone, and I\u2019ve got my wife and kids, but you won\u2019t find anyone who even comes close to being a source. That\u2019s how I protect people, I keep them off the internet.\u201d\nOn governments and conspiracy theories: \u201cUsually it\u2019s about ignorance and stupidity and cowardice rather than any plot,\u201d he says, before moving on to the US\u2019 National Security Agency (NSA). \u201cThe single most overrated agency in the United States is the NSA... It is so fucked up. They can\u2019t get anything right! It\u2019s just the most useless unproductive agency. It doesn\u2019t get much. Yes, any given day if they decide to go after you, they can do a helluva job. But they always could. But it\u2019s also a question of how do they retrieve it?,\u201d he says. Hersh addresses the journalists and hackers in the audience: \u201cI\u2019m not worried about them. I know you guys should be, and you are. I\u2019m going to let you worry about them. I got other things to worry about!\u201d\n\nHersh says young journalists shouldn\u2019t be focused on getting a job at a major outlet if they want to do important investigative journalism. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be in the New York Times or something like that. The New York Times is narrative. You want to be counter-narrative,\u201d he says. \u201cMostly I\u2019m embarrassed for the paper these days, having worked there. And that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t the best there is.\u201d\nHersh on leaked documents: \u201cLet me say this to you real simple: when you have something like these stolen documents, and you decide you\u2019re only going to publish part of it. We\u2019re not breaking the law. We\u2019re not the guys that are violating the rights around the world\u2026 we\u2019re not cheating, we\u2019re not violating the fourth amendment, and also the fifth amendment I would tell you \u2013 the right to self-defence,\u201d he says. \u201cSo why be afraid? Why not write everything? Do it. As the Guardian guy did, why let some thugs come into your office and destroy some documents that you know don\u2019t exist elsewhere?\u2026 We shouldn\u2019t hesitate. The guys who should worry are the guys who are violating the laws.\u201d\nHersh is asked what makes a great story for him, and refers to news this week that Iran had flown some missions against the Islamic State, and the suggestion that this means the US is working with Iran \u2013 and possibly even Syria. \u201cHere\u2019s the reality: we, the Americans have been working, obviously, with the Iranians and the Syrians\u2026 We\u2019re working together. Clearly we have been helping Syria with tactical intelligence for a long time, probably through the Germans\u2026 I just think this is a rich story. I\u2019m not going to do it because I\u2019m doing other things, but it\u2019s a rich story not being told.\u201d\n\nThe next speaker today is investigative journalist Seymour Hersh, interviewed on-stage by author and broadcaster Laura Flanders. With his history of reporting including the My Lai massacre in south Vietnam, various Nixon administration controversies and the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, Hersh is providing the conference\u2019s opening keynote. \u201cHe has been the bad news bear of half a dozen or more administrations in Washington,\u201d says Flanders, by way of introduction, before Hersh kicks off with a mini-speech. \u201cMy view is very simple: the world since I have been old enough to read has basically been run by idiots, nincompoops, thieves... and unfortunately the solution is the idiots who run most of the mainstream media!\u201d He continues, on the purpose of journalism and hacktivism: \u201cThe only purpose I see, what all of us here whether in journalism or in trying to protect information, the whole purpose of what I think we should be doing is counter-narrative. They have their narrative, and we have to show there is another narrative.\u201d\nGavin MacFadyen, director and founder of the Centre for Investigative Journalism, speaks first, introducing the event. He talks about the three groups attending the event: investigative reporters; hackers; and their friends, supporters and sponsors. \u201cGiven the extraordinary dilemmas confronting journalists and hackers both, there is a natural community of interest between all of them,\u201d he said. \u201cThe attacks on journalists have increased\u2026 150 or so killed in the last immediate or so while, and a very large and growing number of hackers being imprisoned, some for astonishingly long sentences, which is horrific especially given that some of them are only teenagers.\u201d MacFadyen outlined the key principles behind the conference: \u201cThere is a free internet, there is a free press, and there is free speech, and we share all of those things together.\u201d\nToday is day one of The Logan Symposium, a gathering in London of journalists, hacktivists, legal and security experts and artists to discuss topics including secrecy, surveillance and censorship. It\u2019s organised by charity the Centre for Investigative Journalism and Goldsmiths, University of London. Over its three days, the event will host speakers including Seymour Hersh, Laura Poitras, John Pilger, Sarah Harrison, Julian Assange, Annie Machon and Jacob Applebaum. The Guardian will be covering each day of the conference, starting with today\u2019s lineup of talks covering journalism; surveillance systems; the Edward Snowden revelations and other leaks; and the past and future of hacking. Expect updates throughout the day of the key points made by speakers, as well as links to any longer reports on the individual sessions.\n", "title": "Live from The Logan Symposium: secrecy, surveillance and censorship"}, {"date": "2013-10-21T20:14:00Z", "body": "The French government summoned the US ambassador in Paris on Monday to demand an urgent explanation over claims that the National Security Agency had engaged in widespread phone and internet surveillance of French citizens. The French daily Le Monde published details from the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden suggesting the US agency had been intercepting French phone traffic on what it termed \"a massive scale\". Le Monde said more than 70m French phone calls had been recorded in one 30-day period late last year. Techniques included the automatic recording of conversations from certain numbers, and sweeping up text messages based on keywords. The paper warned that the interceptions were likely to have targeted not just those with suspected terrorist links but also people in business, politics and the French administration. The French prime minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, said he was shocked and demanded the US provide \"clear answers, justifying the reasons these practices were used and above all creating the conditions of transparency so these practices can be put to an end\". Asked if France should be directly voicing its concerns to Barack Obama, Ayrault said it was up to the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, to take any action, but \"clearly there must be measures and they will be taken\". The White House responded by saying that the US \"gathers foreign intelligence of the type gathered by all nations\". Caitlin Hayden, spokeswoman for the National Security Council at the White House, said: \"We've begun to review the way that we gather intelligence, so that we properly balance the legitimate security concerns of our citizens and allies with the privacy concerns that all people share.\" The claims were published as John Kerry, the US secretary of state, arrived in Paris for the start of a European tour to discuss the Middle East, especially Syria, and keen to stress close military and intelligence ties with Paris, which Kerry recently called the \"oldest ally\" of the US. Laurent Fabius, French foreign minister, is due to meet Kerry on Tuesday to discuss Syria, but a French official said the NSA question would also be raised. Fabius warned: \"This sort of practice between partners that invades privacy is totally unacceptable and we have to make sure, very quickly, that this no longer happens.\" Fabius added: \"We co-operate in a useful way in the fight against terrorism, but that does not justify everything.\" The US ambassador, Charles Rivkin, was summoned to the French foreign ministry hours after Le Monde's investigation was published on Monday morning . A French official said Rivkin was met by the ministry's head of staff, who reminded the US \"that these types of practices between partners are totally unacceptable and we must be assured that they are no longer happening\". The French demanded that Washington provide a full explanation \"and tangible response to our concerns as soon as possible\". Marie Harf, deputy spokesperson at the state department, said the US was keen to ensure that press reports of \"alleged intelligence activities\" would not damage relations with France and other countries. The reports in Le Monde, which were co-written by the outgoing Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald \u2013 who worked with Snowden to lay bare the extent of the NSA's actions \u2013 claimed that between 10 December 2012 and 8 January 2013 the NSA recorded 70.3m phone calls in France. According to the paper, the documents show that the NSA was allegedly targeting not only terrorist suspects but also politicians, businesspeople and members of the administration under a programme codenamed US-985D. The paper said \"French interests\" were \"targeted on a daily basis\". Le Monde highlighted what it called \"techniques used to violate the secrets or simply the private life of French people\". The paper said: \"The agency has several collection methods. When certain French phone numbers are dialled, a signal is activated that triggers the automatic recording of certain conversations. This surveillance also recovered SMS and content based on keywords.\" Such methods, it added, allowed the NSA to keep a systematic record of the history of each target's connections. Le Monde said the unpublished Snowden documents it had seen showed \"intrusion, on a vast scale, both into the private space of French citizens as well as into the secrets of major national firms\". The most recent documents cited by Le Monde, dated April 2013, indicated the NSA's interest in email addresses linked to Wanadoo, once part of France Telecom. About 4.5 million people still use wanadoo.fr email addresses in France. Also targeted was Alcatel-Lucent, a French-American telecoms company that employs more than 70,000 people and works in the sensitive sector of equipping communication networks. One of the documents instructed analysts to draw not only from the electronic surveillance programme, but also from another initiative dubbed Upstream, which allows surveillance on undersea communications cables. Le Monde said one document it consulted showed that between 8 February and 8 March 2013 the NSA collected, worldwide, 124.8bn telephone data items and 97.1bn computer data items. In Europe, only Germany and the UK exceeded France in terms of the numbers of interceptions. Le Monde questioned why the French government had remained so discreet for months on the NSA question, compared with the tougher stance shown by Brazil and Germany. In July Hollande threatened to suspend negotiations for a transatlantic free trade agreement after reports in the Guardian and Der Spiegel that the NSA spied on EU offices and European diplomatic missions in Washington and at the UN in New York. \"We were warned in June [about the programme] and we reacted strongly but obviously we need to go further,\" Fabius said. Also in July, Le Monde reported that France runs its own vast electronic surveillance operation, intercepting and stocking data from citizens' phone and internet activity, using similar methods to the NSA's Prism programme.\n", "title": "Snowden leaks: France summons US envoy over NSA surveillance claims"}, {"date": "2015-06-15T15:19:22Z", "body": "The hostile reaction of the British and US governments to the Snowden disclosures of mass surveillance only served to heighten public suspicion of the work of the intelligence agencies, according to an international conference of senior intelligence and security figures. The recently published official account of a Ditchley Foundation conference last month says one of the event\u2019s main conclusions was that greater transparency about the activities and capabilities of the security services would be essential if their credibility was to be preserved and enhanced around the world. The account of the conference chaired by Sir John Scarlett, the former head of MI6, was published on Friday and makes clear the foundation recognised the widespread public unease following the revelations and that the conditions of data collection about individuals and who has access to it are legitimate areas of concern.\nSir John Holmes, the foundation\u2019s director, said while Snowden\u2019s disclosures had not revealed the intelligence agencies to be out of control, they \u201chad shocked the publics in many countries because they had been unaware of the nature of much intelligence work, as well as uninformed about the authorisation and oversight arrangements already in place\u201d. The conference was attended by leading figures in the British and international intelligence and security community. The UK contingent included Robert Hannigan, director of GCHQ, Lewis Neal, Foreign Office intelligence policy director, and Peter Clarke, ex-head of the Metropolitan police counter-terrorism command, as well as a BBC journalist, Gordon Corera. The participants agreed that \u201cone thing governments and parliaments could do to increase trust and improve awareness was to hold more debates about these issues, rather than trying to avoid them\u201d. They wrote: \u201cThe reaction of the governments most concerned after the Snowden revelations had often appeared as ducking and weaving, trying to reveal as little as possible, or attempting to change the subject, rather than getting ahead of the argument. This had only made things worse and increased public suspicion.\u201d Another participant, the security journalist Duncan Campbell, has reported that to many participants\u2019 surprise, there was general agreement across broad divides of opinion that Snowden had changed the landscape. The journalist wrote that there was agreement that more transparency, or at least \u201ctranslucency\u201d, and providing more information about intelligence activities affecting privacy, was both overdue and necessary. \u201cNo one tried to debate whether Snowden was a villain, traitor or hero,\u201d Campbell said. The indication of a new post-Snowden consensus within the international intelligence and security community of the significance and impact of his disclosures emerges a day after the Sunday Times cited Home Office sources warning that British agents have had to be withdrawn from live operations as a consequence of the Snowden leaks.\nTraditionally, debates on intelligence issues organised by the Ditchley Foundation, which specialises in high-level transatlantic international policy debates, had been kept confidential. But Holmes said it was time for change to reflect \u201cthese more transparent times\u201d. International participants included the EU\u2019s counter-terrorism coordinator, a former acting director of the CIA, Canada\u2019s national security adviser and former senior figures in the German, French and Australian intelligence agencies. The participants debated extensively the issue of the bulk collection of personal data, and while they agreed it did not in itself amount to \u201cmass surveillance\u201d, it could be used for that purpose without proper regulation and oversight. Participants also conceded that as the flood of personal data increases, concerns about individual privacy will not go away any time soon, and that access for the security services to the data held by private companies, such as Twitter and Google, will have to be through the frontdoor and not by secret, backdoor programmes such as the Prism and Tempora schemes revealed by Snowden. According to Holmes\u2019s account, there \u201cwas optimism that relations between private companies and agencies could be regularised and improved post-Snowden\u201d as long as access to individuals\u2019 information was via \u201cproperly authorised, legally sound and specific warrants\u201d. \u201cNothing else would be acceptable to their customers,\u201d the director concluded.\n", "title": "Snowden leak: governments' hostile reaction fuelled public's distrust of spies"}, {"date": "2014-03-09T13:45:48Z", "body": "\u2022 Nick Clegg has closed the Lib Dem conference with a speech stressing his love for Britain and its \u201copen-minded\u201d, liberal qualities. He did not announce any new policies in the speech, but he reaffirmed his determination to fight the European elections on a resolutely pro-EU platform and he said the Lib Dems would represent \u201call of the liberal-minded, liberal-hearted men and women who love the Britain we love \u2013 and who want a party prepared to fight for it.\u201d We will live up to our greatest traditions by keeping Britain engaged, outward facing, a heavyweight in Europe and a leader in the world. If this sounds like the Britain you want, the Liberal Democrats are the party for you. Between now and the election my aim \u2013 our aim \u2013 is to build a coalition bringing together all of the liberal-minded, liberal-hearted men and women who love the Britain we love \u2013 and who want a party prepared to fight for it. That\u2019s the coalition I care about. A coalition of all the people who want to keep this nation open, tolerant, compassionate and strong. \u2022 Clegg has revealed that he intends to serve a full terms as Lib Dem leader if the party is in power after the next election. A spokesman for the Lib Dem leader said that \u201cif the Liberal Democrats are back in government again Nick Clegg intends to serve a full term\u201d. The spokesman was responding to speculation about Clegg\u2019s future. Our entire focus is on delivering Liberal Democrat priorities in government and then getting Liberal Democrats back in government in 2015 as the only party capable of building a stronger economy and a fairer society. Nick Clegg is very much enjoying his role as both Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Democrats. He is only 47. It is for the British people to decide if the Liberal Democrats are back in government again. But if the Liberal Democrats are back in government again then Nick Clegg intends to serve a full term. These comments also imply that, if the Lib Dems are not in power after 2015, Clegg may not choose to hang around. \u2022 The Lib Dems have voted in favour of banning the government from the routine collection of bulk internet data. The proposed restriction is in a digital bill of rights adopted by the party. (See 10.50am and 11.52am.) That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments.\nIt was the Love Actually speech, with Nick Clegg playing Hugh Grant. Rarely can a party leader have delivered a speech with so little in terms of new policy content - rather, it contained nothing, to be precise - but an otherwise humdrum piece of Lib Dem boilerplate was transformed into something really rather effective by Clegg\u2019s sustained, eclectic and very sincere-sounding love letter to Britain near the start of the speech. Okay, David Beckham\u2019s left foot did not get a mention, but virtually everything else did, including queuing, cups of tea and the shipping forecast. He\u2019s not the first politician channel Hugh Grant in this way - remember David Cameron in Russia - but I can\u2019t recall a leader going into patriotism overdrive in such a quirky way in a party conference speech. What made it work, though, was that Clegg managed to link his all-encompassing, National Trust tea towel pro-Britishness with a wider argument about liberalism and open-looking economies. There are few nations as open-minded and warm-hearted as ours. Smart, funny, compassionate Britain. Always changing, always evolving Britain. Humble enough to understand that we must work with others. Confident enough to lead. For me it is these qualities that make this nation great \u2013 these great liberal qualities. Not some sepia-tinted memory of Empire. Not some stuffy parochialism dressed up as patriotism. Most other party leaders could say something similar, of course. But Clegg managed to wrap it up in a narrative that was coherent, and to get the l-word (liberal) in there too. Not bad for a leader at rock bottom in the polls with nothing new to announce. On the subject of leaders, two of them sprung to mind. The first was Tony Blair. Clegg\u2019s stress on the idea of \u201cclosed versus open\u201d being the crucial divide in modern politics (see his interview in the Guardian yesteday) strongly echoes Blair, who has been saying the same thing for years. And, of course, if Clegg was playing Hugh Grant this afternoon, Grant\u2019s character in Love Actually was in part modelled on Blair. Unfortunately for Clegg, though, being Blairish does not get you quite as far in British politics now as it did in the 1990s. The other leader I found myself thinking of was Nigel Farage. At his party conference last week Farage presented his own vision of Britain - a country that is now \u201cunrecognisable\u201d because there are too many foreigners on the train who don\u2019t speak English. Today Clegg offered his alternative depiction of the state of the nation. I\u2019m not exactly a neutral judge, because my demographic profile hardly makes me a Ukip target voter (as a Ukip press officer helpfully reminded me in Torquay last week), but there is no doubt in my mind which account is fairer and more attractive.\nClegg is winding up now. If you have faith in this country, if you believe in Britain\u2019s values, if you still want this incredible island of ours to keep punching above our weight and shaping the world so that it is a better place, put the Liberal Democrats back in government again \u2013 let us protect the Britain you love.\nClegg says the Lib Dems want an education system that allows all children to do as well as they can, more power devolved to cities and communities, and Britain to play its part in the fight against climate change. If this sounds like the Britain you want, the Liberal Democrats are the party for you. Between now and the election my aim \u2013 our aim \u2013 is to build a coalition bringing together all of the liberal-minded, liberal-hearted men and women who love the Britain we love \u2013 and who want a party prepared to fight for it. That\u2019s the coalition I care about. This gets a very loud round of applause. A coalition of all the people who want to keep this nation open, tolerant, compassionate and strong. So to the people out there who may not have voted for us before: it doesn\u2019t matter, that\u2019s the past. What matters now is the kind of country you want to live in. The kind of nation you want us to be. Open not closed. In not out. Great Britain not little England. Forward not back. Hope not fear. The future not the past.\nClegg says the Lib Dems will continue to ensure banks are the servants, not the masters; that growth is sustainable; that the books are balance, but fairly. And, yes, that means that in the coming Budget Danny Alexander and I are pushing to take the Liberal Democrat income tax cut even further than we had originally planned in this parliament. We are about to hit the target that was on the front page of our manifesto: raising the personal allowance so that no one pays a penny of income tax on the first \u00a310,000 they earn, saving over 20 million people \u00a3700. Now we want to go beyond that, taking the total tax cut to \u00a3800.\nLib Dems need to think of this when they are campaigning, he says. When I tell you that we need to get back into government again \u2013 protecting Britain from one party rule \u2013 this is why: Because we are the guardians of a modern, open and tolerant Britain. Because we are the only party who will not ask the British people to choose between a stronger economy and a fairer society. They don\u2019t have to. They can have both if we make our shared mission enabling every single person to get on in life. Because we are the only party with the imagination and ambition needed to ensure Britain draws a line under some of our worst times with our best qualities intact.\nClegg says we have lived through a choice of weak economy or unfair society before. Two parties encumbered by the same old prejudices; straitjacketed by the same old ideologies. And whichever way you look at it, left or right, if either of them get into government on their own, they will drag Britain in the same direction: backwards. No. That\u2019s not my Britain. That\u2019s not the Britain I love. And I am not going to sit back while either of them sweep in and leave this nation diminished and divided because they still don\u2019t understand what makes our country great.\nAnd now he turns to the Conservatives. Or how about widening inequality. A remorseless shrinking of our public services. A party that claims we\u2019re all in it together and yet refuses to ask the wealthy to pay even a penny more in tax towards the on-going fiscal effort. A party which will instead single out one group \u2013 the working age poor \u2013 for especially tough sacrifices. \u00a312bn worth of especially tough sacrifices, from people who are trying to work their way out of poverty and who we should be helping stand on their own two feet.\nClegg attacks Labour. Profligacy. Economic incompetence. A bloated and cumbersome state. Politicians who think that all they need to do to prove themselves is posture against business. A leadership desperate but unable to break free from the grip of its Union paymasters. A party that cannot be relied upon to keep the economy safe; that wants us to put them back behind the wheel even though they still won\u2019t admit how badly they got it wrong.\nClegg says the real test will come in the next parliament. In this coalition we have begun to turn the page, but the real test will come in the next parliament \u2013 when government will have to show whether or not we have really, genuinely, learnt from the mistakes of the past. And I simply do not believe that our opponents have. I simply do not believe that they are up to this task. Left to their own devices what are they offering the British people?\nClegg says the future must be different. Successive governments relying on an overheated financial sector; presiding over a wildly imbalanced economy where the gap between rich and poor grew; where the North fell further and further behind the South. Successive administrations jumping from one set of public service reforms to the next and Whitehall just seemed to carry on regardless as more and more power was sucked up to the centre. I don\u2019t want us ever to go back there. It cannot be right that the country goes through all of this pain only to end up where we started when it all went wrong.\nClegg says the Lib Dems have ensured the government\u2019s economic policy was not just about cuts. He mentions investment in road and rail, the Green Investment Bank, support for business and the apprenticeship programme. Don\u2019t let anyone airbrush out our role. Thanks to the heroic efforts and sacrifices of millions of people we have been able to pull this country back from the brink.\nClegg says this is what the Lib Dems have been trying to deliver in government. There is still a long way to go and many people are still feeling the squeeze. But after a period of grave uncertainty, the British people can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. I hope that makes each and every one of you feel proud: there would be no recovery without the Liberal Democrats.\nThe Lib Dems can offer hope, he says. And that, Liberal Democrats, is what it all comes down to. Hope. It\u2019s the oldest dividing line in politics \u2013 hope versus fear \u2013 and it\u2019s back.\nClegg says the Lib Dems should not assume the Eurosceptics will always win. Forget the lazy assumption that, in the court of public opinion, the eurosceptics will automatically win. There is nothing automatic about election results. A few months ago, when I asked people to take to Twitter to tell me why they\u2019re IN, they did so in their thousands. It was our most successful online campaign ever. There are plenty of people out there who don\u2019t want anger. They don\u2019t want bile. They want jobs. They want our country to have influence. They want opportunities. Ultimately they want hope.\nClegg says being part of the EU gives Britain greater clout. How else would we, right now, be making our presence felt against Vladimir Putin\u2019s Cold War aggression in the Ukraine? The EU is a global economic superpower. By standing shoulder to shoulder with our European partners we have the clout to defend not just our own interests, but the interests of our continent as a whole. So, for all these reasons, I\u2019m IN.\nClegg talks about some of the advantages of EU membership. This isn\u2019t about some starry eyed affection for the EU \u2013 of course it needs reform. But you can\u2019t change it with one foot out the door. You change it by taking your place at the table \u2013 which is where you protect Britain\u2019s national interest and promote our values too.\nClegg says Ukip wants out, the Conservatives are flirting with exit, and Labour are saying nothing at all. The Lib Dems are the only party of in, he says.\nClegg says the same kind of extremism does not exist in the UK. But there is a fight for our future too. An ungenerous, backwards looking politics has emerged in Britain. The politics of blame has found an acceptable face: it wears a big smile and looks like someone you could have a pint with down the pub. So I\u2019m drawing a line in the sand. I am going to defend the tolerant and modern Britain we love, and I am going to start by showing people what\u2019s at stake at the upcoming European elections: do you want Britain in Europe, or out?\nClegg says these problems have led to a rise in extremism around Europe. Taken together, in societies across the Western world, these experiences have created an entirely understandable but dangerous urge to turn inwards. An urge to reject the new or unfamiliar and to shun the outside world. If anyone doesn\u2019t believe it, just glance across the Channel at our European neighbours, where a number of extremist parties are on the rise. In Greece\u2019s last parliamentary election the Golden Dawn Party secured 18 MPs. They ran on an anti-immigration platform. Their slogan? \u2018So we can rid the land of this filth\u2019. Hungary\u2019s Jobbik Party now has 43 MPs, one of whom has called for a register of Jews who he claims \u2018pose a national security risk\u2019. In Bulgaria, Ataka makes up 10% of the National Assembly. One of their MPs has reviled Syrian refugees as \u2018terrible, despicable primates\u2019. In the Netherlands Geert Wilder\u2019s PVV party is polling at around 18%. They have called for the Koran to be banned, comparing it to Mein Kampf. Front National. Around 21%. Their leader, Marine Le Pen, has compared Muslims praying in the streets to the Nazi occupation of France. These are not far flung places. This is our backyard. The forces of chauvinism, protectionism and xenophobia have been emboldened. And there is no doubt about it: the fight is now on for the future direction of our continent.\nClegg says one of the big questions of the time is how to protect the nation\u2019s liberal values. Six years ago Britain suffered an economic \u201ccardiac arrest\u201d. Western power was already under threat, he says. Global power, money and influence have been shifting from West to East and from North to South for years. The previously fashionable view that the world would automatically slide towards greater freedom and democracy now feels presumptuous and na\u00efve. Within our lifetimes America will no longer be the world\u2019s biggest economy. It will be China: an authoritarian state.\nClegg says this open-mindedness is what makes Britain great. For me it is these qualities that make this nation great \u2013 these great liberal qualities. Not some sepia-tinted memory of Empire. Not some stuffy parochialism dressed up as patriotism. In the 21st Century, in a highly competitive, fluid and fast-moving world we hold our own because of our ability to embrace the future rather than cling to the past. It is our ability to look forward and outward and our capacity for reinvention \u2013 in other words our liberalism \u2013 that ensures this small island remains a giant on the world stage. This gets the loudest round of applause so far.\nThe family story goes on. Years later he married a woman who had herself come here to avoid conflict and revolution: my grandmother. She escaped Russia during the revolution, crossing Europe with her family and eventually settling in London. For her Britain offered a place of stability and safety. At a moment of great upheaval, this country welcomed her in and let her call it home. There are few nations as open-minded and warm-hearted as ours. Smart, funny, compassionate Britain. Always changing, always evolving Britain. Humble enough to understand that we must work with others. Confident enough to lead.\nClegg says this is the 100th anniversary of the first world war. His grandfather remembers watching the soldiers come home. He told Clegg that he was upset he could not fight \u201cbecause he passionately believed that to be a British soldier, defending our values of liberty and peace, was the most noble thing you could be\u201d.\nAnd he loves Britain\u2019s internationalism. Above all I love that, while we may be an island, we have always looked beyond our shores. Throughout our history, when we have seen trouble in the world we haven\u2019t just looked the other way; we haven\u2019t just crossed to the other side of the street; Britain doesn\u2019t peer out at the rest of the world and shrug its shoulders. We are always at our best when we play our part.\nClegg contrast the Uk with Russia. I look at what\u2019s happening in places like Russia, where the government is effectively criminalising homosexuality [someone shouts \u201cshame\u201d], and I love that Britain is a place where you can be gay and proud \u2013 and now you can get married too.\nThe love goes on. I love that we do respond \u2013 the clich\u00e9 is true \u2013 to every problem no matter how big or small with the same thing: a cup of tea. I love that, wherever you go in the world, you\u2019ll find football fans obsessed with the Premier League. I love that we are a family of four different countries, each with their own characters, traditions and good-natured rivalries. And that\u2019s why I want to see \u2013 we all want to see \u2013 Scotland stay in our family of nations later this year.\nAnd now he\u2019s getting more political. I love living in a country synonymous with human rights and the rule of law. I love that it was British lawyers who drafted the European Convention on Human Rights and a British Prime Minister who helped launch the Single Market. And I enjoy reminding my Coalition partners that it was a Prime Minister from their party at that.\nIt\u2019s not quite Hugh Grant in Love Actually yet, but he is just getting into his stride. I love that a country capable of extraordinary pomp and ceremony can still retain a spiky irreverence towards its establishment. A country where we line the streets waving our Union Jacks wildly to welcome the arrival of Prince George, and the next moment we\u2019re chuckling at Private Eye\u2019s front page: \u2018Woman Has Baby\u2019. I love that we insist on queuing when we go abroad, even when the locals don\u2019t. I love that the BBC and NHS are known and respected across the planet. I love that our cities are home to every race, religion, colour and language in existence. I love Miriam telling me that the feeling of freedom you get in Britain simply doesn\u2019t exist anywhere else. I love that the shipping forecast is listened to by insomniacs of all ages, right across the country, miles from the sea. I love how excited we get at the glimpse of any sun, insisting on staying out in our t-shirts and flip-flops \u2013 even when it\u2019s obviously still cold.\nClegg is talking about his love for Britain. I love Britain. I love it for all its contradictions. I love that we are as modest as we are proud. I love the way we can cherish our traditions yet innovate relentlessly, churning out one ingenious invention after the next. The telephone, the steam engine, the jet engine, the world wide web; the same nation that came up with stainless steel is now developing graphene \u2013 the strongest material the world has ever seen. Oscar winning visual effects; cutting-edge design; theatre, fashion, music, film \u2013 you name it, we do it, and we\u2019re up there with the best.\nClegg says, in Mexaco, Britain is remembered as the first country to recognise it after independence. In Colombia Britain is know as the country that built their railways. In Ethiopia, meeting the 0.7% aid target is what people mention. So wherever you go one thing is clear: people don\u2019t listen to our country out of some nostalgic deference to an old power. They listen because of who we are. Because of the things we\u2019ve done. Because of the leadership we continue to show. And that makes me incredibly proud.\nClegg starts by saying he has been able to visit other countries in his role as deputy prime minister. There is a threat that runs through each trip. You get to see Britain through other people\u2019s eyes. Everywhere I have been \u2013 every nation around the planet \u2013 has its own story about Britain. On a trade mission to South Korea I paid my respects at a war memorial at the bottom of a hill where, during the Korean War, British soldiers \u2013 heavily outnumbered \u2013 fought for three solid days to hold back North Korean and Chinese forces. It is a battle that every single South Korean schoolchild learns about. Had we given up or been defeated, it could have cost their grandparents the war.\nClegg is coming on stage now. (The music does seem excessively loud.)\nThe Nick Clegg speeches starts with a video showing Clegg saying people should vote for the Lib Dems because they are the party of \u201cin\u201d - in Europe, and in work (because the EU guarantees employment).\nThankfully, Lorely Burt has now taken the Farage mask off. (Rory Bremner\u2019s job is safe.)\nWhile stewards go round the hall with buckets collecting donations, Lorely Burt is on stage wearing a Nigel Farage mask pretending to be \u201cNige\u201d looking for Nick Clegg to debate.\nLord Wrigglesworth is doing a fundraising appeal. He says that, for 16 of the last 18 quarters, the Lib Dems have beaten Labour in terms of getting donations from private donors.\nFarron says the Lib Dems have had the first increase in membership for a governing party for as long as anyone can remember.\nNick Clegg will be starting his speech shortly. Tim Farron is introducing him.\nThe conference has just voted. Delegates rejected Martin Horwood\u2019s call for the line saying the government should not engage in the bulk collection of data to be taken out of the motion. There was a show of hands, and Horwood was defeated quite easily. Then the motion as a whole passed unanimously. \u2022 Lib Dems vote in favour of banning the government from engaging in the routine bulk collection of internet data. Metadata and other internet data on an individual should only be collected \u201cif there is a suspicion of involvement in unlawful activity\u201d, the party has decided.\nJulian Huppert, the Cambridge MP, is summing up the debate. The internet age brings great possibilities, he says. But it brings great risks too. Those risks were not really considered properly in the past. But the Snowden revelations have dragged these concerns \u201ckicking and screaming\u201d into the public eye - although not enough in Britain, he says. He says this motion is not an attack on GCHQ. They do an important job, he says. He commends the Guardian for the responsible way it reported the revelations. It did not just put everything into the public domain, like Wikileaks did. The problem was that politicians wrote rubbish law, he says. He pays particular tribute to JennyWoods, who spoke earlier. At a conference two years ago, she set the party on this course by saying it needed policy on this area, he says. Sir David Omand, the former GCHQ chief, said the collection of internet data should be a last resort. But it is not a last resort at the moment, he says.\nSusan Juned from Stratford upon Avon says the Lib Dems should not sleepwalk into a situation where the routine harvesting of bulk information is okay. The right to privacy can only be limited in a democratic society where it is absolutely necessary. And it should be proportionate, she says.\nEvan Harris, the former MP, says he\u2019s the campaign director of Hacked Off. But today he wants to speak in favour of the newspapers, or some of them, he says. The Guardian has acted responsibly, with the public interest foremost in its concern. But the reaction of some was to shoot the messenger, and to haul its editor into parliament and to ask \u201coutrageously\u201d if he loved Britain. He quotes from stories in other papers attacking newspapers. So, what needs to be done? First, the law should place a duty on the government to protect the interests of the media. Second, there should be more public interest defences in law. And, third, politicians should defend investigative journalism.\nSarah Noble from Calderdale says she joined the Lib Dems on the issue of internet freedom in 2009. Why cannot trust GCHQ and other spy agencies not to spy on law-abiding citizens, she says. On metadata, she says there is no such thing as non-identifying metadata.\nMark Pack from Islington, a member of the federal policy committee and a Lib Dem blogger, says the intelligence services commissioner has only one member of staff. That is not enough to scrutinise all the things he is supposed to scrutinise. When the New York Times published a story about phone hacking, it implied that the law had been broken. But the interception of communications commissioner did nothing. The same thing happened when Nick Davies\u2019s book on the media was published. The interception of communications commissioner ignored the evidence of wrong doing.\nJenny Woods, from Greater Reading, says she recently met Martin Horwood at a constituency event. But she is in favour of the ban on the bulk collection of data. She helped to write the motion, she says. She supports the work of GCHQ. They defend democracy. But they must operate within the law, she says. She says she trusts the security services. But it is not blind trust. That trust should have eyes, she says. It is said humans are not reading the metadata. But humans choose what information is collected, and what words trigger deeper analysis.\nMartin Horwood, the MP for Cheltenham, says thousands of his constituents work at GCHQ. His parents both worked there. And, before that, they worked at Bletchley Park. He says the implication that GCHQ try to get round the law is deeply resented, he says. A friend told him that senior management is very scrupulous about operating within the law. GCHQ employees would be in sympathy with much of this motion,he says. But we need to take care, he says. He says the motion, and Nick Clegg in his speech last week, were right to raise concerns. But there is one line in the motion he objects to, he says. It is the one ruling out the bulk collection of data. That is a bit rich from a party that collects data on voting intention. And companies collect bulk data too, he says. It would be strange for GCHQ to be the only organisation not allowed to collect bulk data. GCHQ is not interested in your cat photos, he tells Tim Farron. You cannot look for needles in a haystack unless you can collect the haystack. He urged delegates to vote against the part of the motion saying the collection of bulk data should not be allowed.\nGreg Judge from Coventry says, when mass data collection takes place, all the data may not be read. But it is still there. Leaks could happen.\nFarron sums up the motion. The time has come for us to establish a digital bill of rights. The 1689 Bill of Rights codified the basic freedoms which we still enjoy today. As we live more of our lives online, we deserve to know that we also enjoy a similar level of freedom in what we do in cyberspace. The motion before you seeks to address the untrammelled power of the state to roam through your digital life. We need to establish a commission of experts to review the powers the state currently holds. America has already vastly outpaced us in their reaction to this information. The time has come for Britain to catch up.\nFarron says \u201cblanket surveillance of any kind is not the answer to combating terrorism\u201d. I do not value someone\u2019s electronic conversations as any less private than their letters or phone calls. We should revise and extend our current legal safeguards to electronic communications as well. For too long, human rights and civil liberties have been denigrated concepts in this country \u2013 our challenge in winning the debate for freedom on this issue, is also a massive opportunity. For millions of British people using digital technology, here is our chance to show that civil liberties and human rights are not esoteric concerns, but things that matter to them in their daily lives. It is our chance to unearth a new generation of liberals who didn\u2019t realise that they were liberals before this. And he says only the Lib Dems can stand up for liberal values. And if we are going to win the battle, it will be Liberal Democrats who win it. We can\u2019t rely on Tories who have prevented a proper Government response to the Snowden leaks.And we can\u2019t rely on the Labour party \u2013 if they\u2019d been in power today, we\u2019d have ID cards, 28 days detention without trial, the imprisonment of the children of asylum seekers, control orders, Gary McKinnon would now be rotting in a US jail, and digital freedoms would have been contemptuously dismissed. No, if you want liberal policies, you\u2019re going to have to support liberals! And, despite a difficult four years in our relationship, I respectfully say that to the Guardian in particular!\nBut, Farron says, the laws governing this activity are out of date, he says. And Labour ignored concerns about this area when they were in power. So we will take Yvette Cooper seriously on this matter when she apologises for Labour\u2019s appallingly authoritarian instincts that got us into this mess. Farron says there has to be a balance between liberty and security. Conference, we should be clear that Britain does face threats. There are groups who seek to target our society, our values and our way of life. The motion before you does not seek to stop our intelligence services from ensuring we are safe to go about our daily lives. It would be easy to denigrate or belittle their efforts, when they are unable to respond. But liberty and security should not be competitors, but two sides of the same coin. We should be strong in the defence of our liberal values, we should be equally strong in our praise of those in the security services who allow us to continue to hold those values and to hold this debate today. He says the Snowen revelatons have triggered a proper debate in the US. In America, Senators and Representatives from both parties have worked together to challenge the overwhelming power of state surveillance. The White House commissioned a report into its surveillance powers and the resulting document offered 40 recommendations on how the intelligence services can operate in a more transparent manner. And he attacks those who have attacked the Guardian over its reporting. In the UK, we have had to endure the sight of senior politicians attacking the Guardian for having the temerity to try and inform the public of what is done in our name. For a Prime Minister who pretends to be so concerned with ensuring the freedom of the press, he has a funny way of showing it. Fellow media outlets have even lambasted the Guardian for their brave revelations. They should be ashamed of themselves. Don\u2019t they realise that even the most hysterical distortions of the Leveson proposals are nothing compared to these threats to our freedom? We should be appalled at the supine nature of too many British politicians and institutions, and we should be proud and unsurprised that it has been Liberal Democrats who have stood out from the crowd and stood up for our freedoms.\nFarron talks about the impact of the Edward Snowden revelations. It will soon be almost a year since the world first heard the name Edward Snowden. In the months that have followed, we have slowly built up a picture of the full extent and scale of the state\u2019s ability to intercept our every electronic utterance. Every email. Every tweet. Every facebook post. Your browsing history. Your diary. Your shopping list. The intelligence services can now call on powers which would have been completely unimaginable even ten years ago.\nTim Farron, the Lib Dem president, is opening the debate. He starts with a joke about the power of the internet. When I was messing around on Facebook, instead of getting on and writing this speech, one of my friends posted up a question. They asked: \u201cIf someone from the 1950\u2019s were to travel through time to the present day, what is the most astonishing thing you could say to them?\u201d And the answer? Well, how about \u201cIn my pocket, I have a device capable of accessing the sum of all human knowledge in seconds.And I use it to get into arguments with strangers and look at funny pictures of cats.\u201d He says, within two decades, the internet has become an intrinsic part of our lives. But it has also become the biggest liability, he says.\nThe Lib Dems are now about to start the debate on internet surveillance. Here are extracts from the Lib Dem motion on a digital bill of rights. The full text is in the conference agenda (pdf). Conference believes: i) Monitoring or surveilling people without suspicion is alien to our traditional British values. ii) That systematic surveillance of people\u2019s communications and online activities undermines a number of fundamental human rights, including the right to respect of private life and correspondence, freedom of expression, of association, of conscience and of religion; that these rights are essential in safeguarding the democratic principles of our society; and that any interference with these rights must be necessary and proportionate. iii) That our online communication and behaviour should be treated with the same respect and legal due process that we expect for our offline communication and behaviour. iv) Government-supported filtering of the internet will prevent people from accessing legitimate information and educational resources, whilst giving parents a false sense of security. v) That the indiscriminate harvesting and storage of the communications and metadata of people without suspicion is incompatible with our liberal and democratic principles, and has the potential to cast a chilling effect on free speech and free association. vi) Whilst there are legitimate concerns surrounding national security, such concerns must not be invoked simply as a pretext to undertake blanket surveillance, stifle investigative journalism, or discourage public debate. vii) That the work of the intelligence and security services is essential to the underpinning of a free, fair and open society, and that clear public agreement as to their remit and the extent of their powers would be to their benefit as well the country more broadly .... .... Conference therefore calls for: 1. The annual release of Government Transparency Reports which publish, as a minimum, the annual number of user data requests made by law enforcement, the intelligence agencies, and other authorities, broken down by requesting authority, success rates, types of data requested and category of crime or event being investigated. 2. The establishment of a commission of experts to review state surveillance and all recent allegations from the Edward Snowden leaks, with specific scope to: a) Scrutinise relevant legislation including the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, the Intelligence Services Act 1994 and section 94 of the Telecommunications Act 1984. b) Assess the implications for privacy and internet freedoms of Project Tempora and other programmes revealed by the Snowden leaks, and consider alternatives to the bulk collection of data. c) Review powers, scope, appointment and resources of oversight committees, commissioners and tribunals. d) Consider the use of judicial involvement and approval for surveillance and for access to communications data and metadata likely to reveal sensitive personal data. e) Publish its findings and recommendations. 3. The Government to define and enshrine the digital rights of the citizen to protect from overreach by the state, through: a) Ensuring that powers of surveillance, accessing data, and accessing new technologies are not extended without Parliamentary approval. b) Ensuring that government does not undertake the bulk collection of data and only accesses the metadata or content of communications of an individual if there is suspicion of involvement in unlawful activity. c) Ensuring that oversight of government surveillance is independent, informed, transparent and adequate. d) Supporting a prompt, lawful and transparent framework for data requests across jurisdictions and between governments. 4. The Government to accelerate and expand the midata project, to grant citizens access to all their data in an open digital format, regardless of which business holds that data, by using powers under the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013.\nSimon Hughes, the justice minister, says the Lib Dems need to speak up more for the European court of human rights. He says he hears \u201csiren voices\u201d in the Ministry of Justice (ie, Chris Grayling) suggesting Britain should abandon its commitments under the European convention on human rights. But that would be a mistake. He says he will lead a campaign to turn around public opinion on the European convention.\nWilliam Wallace (Lord Wallace of Saltaire) says he has been the Lib Dem minister leading on the government\u2019s \u201cbalance of compentencies\u201d review of EU powers. The evidence overwhelmingly supports the current arrangements, he says. It is remarkable how little the \u201cheadbangers\u201d on the Conservative side have wanted to engage with the evidence, he says. He says John Redwood even criticised William Hague for wanting to engage in reality-based politics.\nFor the record, here today\u2019s YouGov GB polling figures. Labour: 39% (down 1 point from YouGov on Friday) Conservatives: 32% (up 1) Ukip: 14% (up 1) Lib Dems: 10% (up 1) Labour lead: 7 points (down 2) Government approval: -20 (up 12) According to Electoral Calculus, this would give Labour a majority of 88. The Lib Dems would lose 36 seats, and be left with 21.\nNeville Hunnings says he is speaking against the motion. (That\u2019s surprising, because, in Lib Dem terms, it seems very uncontentious. You can read it in the agenda paper here - pdf.) Hunnings says he has worked most of his life implementing European law. But he is opposing the motion because it treats the EU just as a free trade area, he explains. It is more than that. It has a mechanism for securing peace. In the 1960s his Swedish-born wife was spat upon because people thought she was German. That would never happen now, he says. The EU has united north Europe and south Europe. Even the Romans did not manage that, he says.\nMartin Horwood MP is now opening the debate on Europe. He says recently Lib Dem MPs were shown some research about the popularity of Lib Dem policy ideas. The one that came out on top was using the European arrest warrant to catch criminals. That shows that the Lib Dems should not be embarrassed about their European policies, he says. Unlike the Tories, the Lib Dems are united on Europe. But, just defending the EU, is not enough. You do not stand for a council saying \u201ccouncils are great\u201d. He runs through a long list of Lib Dem MEPs, and talks about the campaigns they have championed. They include Sir Graham Watson, who pushed for the European arrest warrant, he says.\nIn the Ukraine debate, Spencer Hagard says he has taken a keen interest in Ukraine because his grandparents were from Hungary. His first memories are of the death of Stalin and the Russian invasion of Hungary in 1956. He says the people of Crimea should be able to decide their future in a free and fair referendum. But that cannot happen next Sunday \u201cunder the dark cloud of Russian arms\u201d. He also says that the European Union should bind countries like Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania more closely into the EU by making Russian an official EU language.\nHere are some of the main Lib Dem stories and articles in the Sunday papers. \u2022 Simon Walters and Brendan Carlin in the Mail on Sunday says Danny Alexander is engaged in a power struggle with Vince Cable. Liberal Democrat Cabinet Minister Danny Alexander was accused last night of positioning himself to succeed Nick Clegg after he appeared to initiate a power struggle with Vince Cable. Business Secretary Mr Cable is furious that Treasury Chief Secretary Mr Alexander is demanding to be the party\u2019s main economic spokesman at next year\u2019s General Election. Lib Dem MPs have accused Mr Alexander, 41, of using the issue to further his ambition of taking over in the event that the party flops at the polls and Mr Clegg is forced to resign. \u2022 Daniel Boffey in the Observer says Nick Clegg faces a rebellion from northern MPs. Nick Clegg\u2019s plans for this weekend\u2019s Liberal Democrat spring party conference in York risk being derailed by a rebellion from his northern MPs, peers and council leaders, who have made public their anger at the coalition\u2019s failure to deal with the north-south economic divide. \u2022 Jenny Willott, the Lib Dem employment minister, tells the Independent on Sunday that all parties should consider promising free childcare for one-year-olds in their general election manifestos. All parties should consider pledging free childcare for one-year-olds in their general election manifestos to help encourage women to resume their careers, the minister for employment has said. In an interview with The Independent on Sunday, Jenny Willott, who is also minister for women, said extending childcare to babies would be expensive but \u201cit may well be that it\u2019s the right thing to do\u201d. Ms Willott, the Liberal Democrat MP for Cardiff Central, also called for headhunting companies to provide details of how many women they place on shortlists for City jobs, including senior board positions, to increase transparency in the process. \u2022 Marie Woolf and Nicky Harley in the Sunday Times (paywall) says Clegg wants to enshrine the 0.7% aid target in law. Nick Clegg wants to enshrine in law Britain\u2019s commitment to devote 7p of every \u00a310 of national income to providing foreign aid. The deputy prime minister is pressing for a bill in the next session of parliament to make the provision of 0.7% of gross national income to the international development budget legally binding. The proposal, which the Liberal Democrat leader is discussing with David Cameron and George Osborne, the chancellor, will infuriate Conservative backbenchers who oppose the ring-fencing of the budget of the Department for International Development (DfID) when there are cuts across Whitehall. \u2022 Andrew Rawnsley in the Observer says some of the rows between the Lib Dems and the Conservatives over policy partially staged. Connoisseurs of American professional wrestling know that it is an essential prerequisite for enjoying the spectacle that you can suspend disbelief. A move such as \u201cthe piledriver\u201d would, if for real, render its victim a quadriplegic. And yet the contestants nearly always bounce back to life to hurl themselves around the ring and into the next clinch. It is only by accident that anyone genuinely gets hurt. It was a senior aide to David Cameron who recently introduced me to this way of thinking about the coalition when we were having a conversation about the clashes between the Tories and the Lib Dems. There are many \u201cplay fights\u201d between them, which are as stagey as those in American wrestling and amount to choreographed displays of their disagreements. Quite often, when the media reports a coalition \u201crow\u201d between the Tories and the Lib Dems, it has been confected by one or both of them because someone thinks it suits them to be seen on opposing sides of an issue. \u2022 The Sun on Sunday says Clegg has joined the selfie bandwagon. That is a reference to this.\nIn the Ukraine debate Scott Walker says he knows Ukraine well. The people of Crimea do not think of themselves as Russian or Ukrainian, he says. They think of themselves as Crimean. They favour autonomy. The Ukrainian government should accept self-determination for Crimea, he says. But any referendum must be free and fair.\nSimon Hughes, the justice minister, is speaking in the Ukraine debate. He says he has taken an interest in Ukraine for years. He has been there for work reasons, and on holiday. We have undervalued it, he says, both its size and its importance. He was there two weeks ago, he says. So many people in the country look to the UK for a lead. He says there is a huge democratic deficit in the country. Ukraine lodges the third largest number of complaints with the European court of human rights, after Russia (first) and Italy (second). There is a desire for human rights there, he says.\nNick Clegg wraps up the Lib Dem spring conference this morning with a speech just before lunchtime. And before that there are three debates. According to the excerpts from the speech released in advance, Clegg will focus on the European elections, and attack Ukip\u2019s \u201cbackwards-looking politics\u201d. An ungenerous, backwards-looking politics has emerged in Britain. The politics of blame has found an acceptable face: it wears a big smile and looks like someone you could have a pint with down the pub. So I\u2019m drawing a line in the sand. I am going to defend the tolerant and modern Britain we love, and I am going to start by showing people what\u2019s at stake at the upcoming European elections: do you want Britain in Europe, or out? That\u2019s the real question in May. One party wants out. Another is flirting with exit. The other lot don\u2019t have the courage of their convictions on this - they\u2019re saying nothing at all. The Liberal Democrats are now Britain\u2019s only party of In. The only party out there explaining the clear benefits of Britain\u2019s place in Europe. The only party giving people the facts. Here\u2019s the agenda. 9am: Debate on Ukraine. 9.45am: Martin Horwood MP opens a debate on Europe. The motion says that the Lib Dems should be the party of \u201cin\u201d - in Europe, in work - and proposes themes for the party\u2019s European elections manifesto. 10.45am: Tim Farron, the Lib Dem president, opens a debate on a digital bill of rights. As Nicholas Watt reports, Farron will say that a digital bill of rights should be established in Britain to ensure that basic online freedoms are protected from the \u201cuntrammelled power of the state\u201d. 11.45am: Clegg closes the conference with his speech.

The UK passed \u201cemergency\u201d legislation, referred to as the Drip Act, expanding mass surveillance powers in the wake of European court judgments. In the US, modest reforms to domestic mass surveillance failed to pass Congress. Ireland retrospectively made legal UK mass surveillance efforts related to the country, while even Germany \u2013 one of the most outspoken nations on surveillance \u2013 has challenged Der Spiegel\u2019s reporting of the tapping of Angela Merkel\u2019s phone. On surveillance, 2014 was the year the administration struck back. But while the Conservative party in the UK has made it clear it would like to further extend surveillance powers, both sides of the Atlantic might find next year a closer fight than they would think. Two key pieces of legislation authorising surveillance are coming up for renewal. Most important is the Patriot Act, which must be renewed by 1 June, or else go out of force \u2013 taking with it the NSA\u2019s collection of US phone details. In the UK, the major parties have pledged to re-examine the critical Ripa legislation, which authorises most UK mass-surveillance programmes, after the election \u2013 and have to renew the Drip legislation by the end of 2016. The other key place to watch will be the courts: there are multiple challenges in UK tribunals, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the European court of justice, and several cases attempting to get the US supreme court to make its first surveillance rulings since Edward Snowden\u2019s leaks.\nThe technological backdrop is similarly mixed: in the immediate wake of Snowden, a flurry of new companies promising privacy arose, but there\u2019s not yet a definitive app, while incumbents such as Tor have revealed several attacks and security breaches (since fixed). Conversely, though, major players are starting to regard privacy as a selling point: Google and others are encrypting ever more of their traffic, and even enhancing privacy controls over which information the search and social giants store. So it\u2019s all to play for in the year ahead. Against a backdrop of high-profile hacks and terror attacks in western cities, it\u2019s conceivable that surveillance powers will be strengthened. But the post-Snowden reform movement still has momentum, and there\u2019s every chance that documents from Snowden or some other whistleblower could influence the debate in 2015.\n", "title": "When it comes to surveillance, there is everything to play for | James Ball"}, {"date": "2016-08-01T12:49:02Z", "body": "When we rejoin Jason Bourne in the series\u2019 latest instalment he is shirtless, with his fists raised, looking in very fine fettle indeed. He looks the part: the film itself is a wiry, stripped-down thriller, and its leanness is the best thing about it.\nJason Bourne is at heart an extended chase sequence in which frazzled goons emerge from unmarked vans to set off after our absconding hero, while tetchy bosses back in Langley attempt to orchestrate things via a cascade of satellite feeds. If that sounds familiar, it should: Enemy of the State was released 18 years ago and has been a staple of Friday-night TV schedules ever since. Swap a beefed-up Matt Damon for a dressing-gowned Will Smith, and the two films are, for large swaths at least, pretty much interchangeable. Nor are they alone in this respect. The intervening years have seen, among others, Eagle Eye, Closed Circuit, Echelon Conspiracy and the first three Bourne films take the same blueprint and run with it, with varying degrees of success but little variance in premise and plot.\nThis sense of deja vu with a summer blockbuster shouldn\u2019t be a surprise, but given how these films hinge upon the dazzling capacities of the day\u2019s cutting-edge tech, there\u2019s something especially odd about the similarities in their specifics: in Jason Bourne, as in Enemy of the State, mobile phones are surreptitiously slipped into pockets as ersatz tracking devices, fuzzy crowd images are enhanced on a monitor until a familiar face sharpens from the pixels, instructions are barked from a gleaming government HQ into the earpieces of pistol-toting footsoldiers. Admittedly, Enemy of the State\u2019s cronies had to actually break into their target\u2019s house to plant their bugs \u2013 no need for such quaint tactics this time round. But given all we hear about the breakneck rate of technological advancement, it\u2019s notable how little the gadgetry in these tech-centric films has changed in two decades.\nPaul Greengrass and co dutifully update Jason Bourne to include a subplot about a Zuckerbergian social media guru, and there\u2019s a pointed line from one CIA suit that a hack into their mainframe \u201ccould be worse than Snowden\u201d, but these topical tweaks are largely cosmetic. The plot essentially revolves around a government agency trying to kill a man to keep a lid on its own shadowy operations \u2013 a tradition that harks back beyond Will Smith\u2019s semi-clothed skedaddling and to the grand splurge of paranoid thrillers of the 1970s, when films such as The Parallax View, Blow Out and The Conversation played out America\u2019s post-Watergate neuroses on the big screen. The Bourne films have become touchstones of modern-era action cinema; 1992\u2019s Sneakers is an underrated caper; The Lives of Others rekindled the fatalistic angst of the 70s classics. Enemy of the State stands up as a minor masterpiece, its riotous fun undimmed by the splurge of aping TV shows (24, Spooks, Alias) that trailed in its wake. And four years after Smith was prising tracers from his shoe heels to keep himself off-grid, Tom Cruise was prising out his own eyeball to the same ends in Minority Report, a film that anticipated the themes of corporate/government collusion that run through Greengrass\u2019s latest effort with appropriate prescience.\nNone of this, then, is new. The McGuffins of 2016 may be USB sticks rather than cassette tapes, but four decades after Harry Caul finally realised \u201cthey\u2019d kill us if they got the chance\u201d, the surveillance movie is not only alive and well, but its tropes have been tampered with very little indeed. The obvious move is to chalk this down to Hollywood\u2019s great poverty of imagination, a risk-averse popcorn factory reheating the same tried and tested idea on repeat. But that would be to do the films an injustice. The surveillance movie may be time-honoured, but it\u2019s far from outdated. As the Freudian brainiacs will tell you, watching people watch people will always have its place in cinema \u2013 but more obviously, these films continue to get made because they continue to get our attention. Be it Edward Snowden\u2019s leaks from the NSA or the snooper\u2019s charter on this side of the pond, you only need to open a newspaper (or a laptop) to recognise that the genre\u2019s longevity is testament not to screenwriting laziness but to its own real-world relevance. Nearly half a century on from Tricky Dicky hiring a team of real-life Harry Cauls to bug his Oval Office, the politics of privacy is as hotly debated as ever. The issues played out by Bourne and co may not be new, but they\u2019re still in the news. And so it makes sense for these films to have changed so little over the years: our anxieties around secrecy, security and surveillance remain much the same \u2013 and it\u2019s only right that Hollywood continues to tap into them.\n", "title": "Bourne again: why spy movies are still tapping into the same formula"}, {"date": "2014-01-17T16:33:03Z", "body": "What we have no words for we cannot discuss except crudely. The latest revelation about the security services brings a new word to our growing vocabulary: Dishfire. This week's expos\u00e9 reveals the NSA collecting and extracting personal information from hundreds of millions of text messages a day. While messages from US phone numbers are removed from the database, documents show GCHQ used it to search the metadata of \"untargeted and unwarranted\" communications belonging to British citizens. We are not so much free citizens, innocent until proven guilty, but rather, as one of the Dishfire slides says, a \"rich data set awaiting exploitation\". Prism, Tempora, Upstream, Bullrun \u2013 as our language grows we begin to speak with greater clarity. We move from James Bond fantasies to a greater understanding of what the intelligence services actually do in our name and with our money. Is indiscriminate, dragnet surveillance the best way to protect democracy? It is proving bad for business. Google, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft are trying to salvage their reputations by fighting against their own governments to protect customer data. Vodafone's head of privacy spoke out this week, asking British ministers, and the governments of the 25 countries in which it operates, for the right to publish the number of demands it receives for interceptions and customer data. The company wants to follow its US counterparts AT&T and Verizon and publish a transparency report \u2013 but of the 25 markets, including India, Turkey and South Africa, where it operates, the UK is one of the most restrictive in terms of the public's right to know. The Regulation of Investigatory Powers (Ripa) Act 2000 states that: \"Where an interception warrant has been issued or renewed, it shall be the duty of every person falling within subsection (2) to keep secret all the matters mentioned in subsection (3).\" In plain English: those in receipt of a warrant must keep secret not only the contents of the warrant but its very existence. Neither Vodafone, nor any other phone company, can tell the public how many demands it receives. The penalty for disclosure is a prison term of up to five years. Ripa was controversial when introduced, but it was an improvement on an earlier version, which required everyone to give up their passwords to police on pain of prison. That's not to say the current law would be unwelcome in an oppressive society. It demands loyalty to the state, official secrecy without a public interest defence. Telecommunications companies are specifically named in the law to stay schtum. How can we have a meaningful conversation about wiretapping telephones when even the number of warrants is a state secret? In the US, the public often learn about the FBI's use of covert surveillance in court. Their methods and practices are examined as evidence brought to trial. On Friday Barack Obama announced new curbs on his security agencies. He has made moves to respond, as Britain has not, to public disquiet. In the UK, Ripa forbids the contents of interceptions from being used in court. They cannot be used even if they would prove a person's guilt. That is problematic not only for justice but also for public accountability. Being tested in the courts is one of the main ways we could learn how and under what circumstances interception is employed. Is it tightly targeted against those whom the state has probable cause to suspect; or willy nilly, a dragnet, based on little more than prejudice? We just don't know. In George Orwell's 1984, Newspeak meant the dictionaries became smaller not bigger. Fewer words meant fewer thoughts. What we have no language for we cannot discuss. For too long we've had no language to discuss the intelligence services. Now a dictionary is being written. It will be interesting to see what new words are added.\n", "title": "NSA leaks: Dishfire revelations have exposed the flaws in UK laws on surveillance | Heather Brooke"}, {"date": "2014-03-31T17:07:58Z", "body": "Sir Martin Sorrell, the chief executive of WPP, has said businesses continue to underestimate the importance the Edward Snowden's NSA electronic surveillance revelations have had on consumer attitudes to privacy and security. Sorrell, speaking at the Ad Week Europe conference in London on Monday, said the global advertising and marketing industry had failed to grasp the importance of the ramifications of the revelations to their clients. \"People understate the importance of Snowden and NSA,\" he said. \"[They] underestimate the impact on consumers, and if you take the hacking going on \u2013 credit card information, etc \u2013 there are two things [going on]. One is privacy and the other is security or secrecy. If you solve the security thing \u2013 a hacker-proof system, which may be an oxymoron \u2013 if you can solve the safety issue, the privacy issue falls away.\" Sorrell made the comments while in conversation with Robert Thomson, the chief executive of Wall Street Journal and Times publisher News Corp, who said that the company has been examining its advertising proposition to tighten security and privacy. \"The NSA controversy has heightened awareness of [privacy and security],\" he said. \"Being very transparent with clients, readers, customers about the [browsing] experience they are having and consequences of it. \"We have been removing third-party networks for our sites, those ads are also data-gathering mechanisms.

This year\u2019s Drones for Good awards finalists included social enterprises hoping to develop unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to deliver vaccinations in Africa, provide better planning in India\u2019s slums and help with international disaster relief planning. In business, companies such as Amazon and Facebook have been grabbing the headlines and the public\u2019s imagination with multimillion-dollar research into drones for same-day deliveries and to expand the internet to remote parts of the world. While these are a long way from commercial reality, other industries are finding numerous uses for drone technology \u2013 uses that could bring wider benefits to the environment and society, as well as greater efficiencies. BP, granted the first commercial license to fly drones over US soil in June last year, uses UAVs to monitor its oil infrastructure in Alaska, helping to spot potential pipeline leaks and protect the safety of its workforce on the ground.\n\u201cThis technology is proving invaluable at our Prudhoe Bay site, where floods, ice break-ups and ice floes constantly alter the topography, making other monitoring methods difficult, costly and time-consuming,\u201d says a BP spokesperson. Elsewhere, BP says it is using drones to produce 3D models of outcrops in Azerbaijan and has flown an unmanned \u201coctocopter\u201d around a 100m cooling tower in Hull to check its integrity, \u201cremoving the need for scaffolding and people working at height\u201d. Another multinational and one of the world\u2019s largest agricultural companies, Cargill, is just starting to use drones to help monitor its commitment to zero deforestation in its palm oil supply chains in Indonesia. \u201cThe drones will help us map, identify and monitor environmentally sensitive areas,\u201d says Tom Vandyck, media specialist at Cargill. \u201cThey\u2019ll also augment our efforts against burning and illegal forest clearing through faster and more accurate detection. With the right sensor on board, they can help us with yield intensification \u2013 a plus on the sustainability side, because it means more palm oil from the same amount of land.\u201d It\u2019s an interesting example of a company employing the methods used by conservation charities campaigning against it as a tool for its own sustainability strategy. While it\u2019s too earlyfor meaningful results from the drones, Vandyck says Cargill is planning to allow independent third parties to produce publicly-available maps of their plantations to ensure impartiality. \u201cAs drones and sensors get more advanced, we can expect them to play increasingly important roles,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re cheaper to operate than acquiring images from satellites, deployable on short notice, unhindered by cloud cover and generate images at a much higher resolution.\u201d But he adds: \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that drones alone do not improve sustainability \u2013 it is the action we take on the information gathered that makes the impact.\u201d Jonathan Evans, assistant land management adviser at the National Farmer\u2019s Union, agrees that it\u2019s the analysis of the data provided, and the management decisions drones help inform, that matter. Farmers have been among their earliest commercial adopters in the UK, and their use to survey crop health and yields, monitor livestock and even deter pigeons is increasing every year.\n\u201cThe whole idea of drones in arable production is to improve production and efficiency, making more efficient use of pesticides and fertilisers by identifying sections that need them or where they can be best used,\u201d says Evans. \u201cThe agronomists and farmers work alongside third party companies actually doing the analysis, so it\u2019s creating more opportunities for these companies to grow.\u201d One such company is Ursula Agriculture, which began in 2013 as a research project funded by the Welsh Assembly and now works with international agrichemical companies such as Syngenta and Bayer Crop Science. \u201cWe can identify weeds, like black grass, because it has a different spectral range than the crop,\u201d says Ursula Agriculture\u2019s William Allbrook. \u201cWe can be pretty precise, making a map, processing the data and providing it to a GPS tractor for spraying.\u201d Allbrook believes the market for drones in UK agriculture is \u201cquite immature\u201d and only economical for the big producers. But as the UAV industry starts to scale, prices will come down and the sight of unmanned drones flying across the UK countryside will become \u201croutine\u201d. Certainly, the US and EU are actively preparing for a future economic boom around drones. Congress has instructed the Federal Aviation Administration to give commercial drones access to all US skies by September 2015. The EU announced plans last year to unify regulations around UAVs with the aim of creating 150,000 jobs in the sector by 2050. \u201cI think that\u2019s a hugely conservative figure and the UK will take a large chunk of it,\u201d says Gary Clayton, chairman of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Systems Association (UAVS), who gave evidence to a House of Lords report on the EU plans published in February. \u201cThere are thousands of jobs in UAVs in the UK already \u2013 operators, researchers, component manufacturers \u2013 and there are thousands more across Europe.\u201d UAVS was formed 18 years ago by a handful of UK independent operators and major defence companies. Now its membership numbers over a hundred and the Civil Aviation Authority has more than 600 licensed commercial UAV operators on its books. \u201cTen years ago we thought drones would just be used for maritime surveillance and dull, dirty and dangerous work,\u201d says Clayton. \u201cNow they\u2019re part of making BBC dramas, surveyors\u2019 reports and oil production. \u201cThe really big explosion will come when the technologies come that allow large systems to fly in national airspace,\u201d he says, which could herald the introduction of unmanned aeroplanes that are lighter, faster and far more fuel efficient. \u201cThen you\u2019ll see everything from 150kg drones to 737s flying around.\u201d The technology and innovation hub is funded by BT.

As Cameron warned the internet giants that they must do more to ensure they do not become platforms for terrorist communications, the US president said he welcomed the way in which civil liberties groups hold them to account by tapping them on the shoulder. Read the full piece here. Obama and Cameron warn Congress over Iran sanctions vote Barack Obama and David Cameron have warned of possible military confrontation with Iran if Congress succeeds in passing new sanctions legislation rather than giving nuclear non-proliferation talks more time. In a joint press conference characterised by unusually blunt pressure on US lawmakers, the president said he would veto their proposed legislation if it reached his desk. The British prime minister revealed he was making personal calls to senators during his visit to Washington to dissuade them from passing the bill in the first place. Read the full piece here \u2013 and thanks for reading.\nThen, as the two men advanced towards the cameras, we noticed Obama was doing most of the talking \u2013 while he was waving his arms around and holding forth, poor Cameron was consigned to the passive role of listener; another Obama technique for making clear to everyone who\u2019s really in control. Read the full piece here.\nCameron is said to be spending the afternoon speaking with more United States congress members about nuclear negotiations with Iran. Obama, meanwhile, is planning a nice evening at home, according to the White House. He is scheduled to host cast and crew members of the movie Selma, about Martin Luther King Jr and the voting rights movement, for a private screening.\n\nIf you heard some disdain for Congress in Obama\u2019s threat to veto any new Iran sanctions they may send him, you aren\u2019t the only one. Democratic Senator Robert Menendez, who has drafted an Iran sanctions bill, took personal offense and got into an argument with the president after Obama lectured senators on the topic on Thursday, the New York Times reports: Mr. Menendez told the president that he had worked for more than 20 years to curb Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions and had always been focused on the long-term implications. Mr. Menendez also warned the president that sanctions could not be imposed quickly if Congress waited to act and the talks failed, according to two people who were present. \u201cIt was a forceful exchange between two strong personalities,\u201d the senator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations, said. \u201cIt was not an angry exchange. It was clear, forceful, vigorous.\u201d Read the full piece here.\nFrom the comments: An argument that Cameron is attempting to puff himself up before elections in May:\nAnd a look at potential future leadership on the world stage:\nHere\u2019s a summary of what came out of the Obama-Cameron news conference at the White House: New US-UK cooperation on cybersecurity was announced, but a possible new agreement on weakened web encryption standards notably was not. Obama said the US government would open \u201ca dialogue\u201d with US tech companies to find ways to allow government surveillance of potential terrorists and unfolding terror plots. Obama said the government \u2018can do better\u2019 at respecting privacy and the law while conducting surveillance. The US president was firm, however, on the need for new surveillance through tech companies like Google and Twitter. Cameron rebutted the notion that a terror attack in the UK was \u201cimminent\u201d but said that based on threat levels an attack was \u201chighly likely.\u201d Obama said \u201cI will veto\u201d any new sanctions on Iran passed by Congress before nuclear negotiations are allowed to run their course. Obama said Congress should understand that failed negotiations would increase the risk of military confrontation, but said: \u201cI am not, I repeat not, suggesting that we are on immediate war footing with Iran should negotiations fail.\u201d Cameron admitted calling US senators to lobby them on the issue, but he said it was not a case of a British prime minister telling US lawmakers what to do. Obama said the US had not been \u201cstanding on the sidelines\u201d during the Syrian war. \u201cIt\u2019s true that we did not invade Syria,\u201d he said. At the top of the news conference, Obama clarified that his calling Cameron \u201cbro\u201d meant they were friends.\nAlan Travis is Guardian home affairs editor. He reports there may have been an unbridgeable gap between the closest of allies on web surveillance and weakening encryption:\n\u201cFor the most part people who are worried about Big Brother sometimes obscure or deliberately ignore all the legal protections that have been put in place\u201d to rein in surveillance, Obama says. #oversight Obama continues: \u201cThe technologies are evolving in ways that potentially make this trickier. If we get into a situation that the technologies do not allow us at all\u201d to track a terror plot... if we are confident this individual or network is about to activate a plot... and despite having a phone number, social media address or email address, and we can\u2019t penetrate that? That\u2019s a problem. And that\u2019s the dialogue we\u2019re having with these companies.\nObama said in the US, as in the UK, terror \u201cthreat streams are fairly constant. David deals with them every day I deal with them every day.\u201d He says wiretapping is not current technology and the question is how to make surveillance work in the new tech landscape. Obama: \u201cThe dialogue we\u2019re engaged in is to make sure that ... we\u2019re confident that if there is a threat out there... [we] can identify that threat and track that threat\u201d without \u201cdigging into whatever texts you might be sending on your smart phone.\u201d\nSecond British questioner asks one of the same questions, about whether an attack in the UK is imminent or \u201calmost inevitable\u201d. \u201cOn the issue of the threat that we face, the level is threat at severe,\u201d Cameron says. If an attack were imminent the threat level would \u201cmove to the next level, which is critical.\u201d In terms of the protection of the Jewish community... this is based on what has happened in France... and it is sensible, precautionary measures to make sure we do what we can to reassure those communities. Cameron said it was moving that protesters held up posters saying \u201cje suis flic, I\u2019m a cop, and je suis juif, I\u2019m a Jew.\u201d\nObama said the US and UK could \u201cdo better\u201d to ensure that surveillance programs \u201coperate within the law and address privacy concerns:\nObama says the US government will talk with tech companies about finding a way for the government to use the companies\u2019 data to stop terrorism. \u201cWe still have to find ways, if an Al-Qaeda affiliate is operating in the United States\u201d or elsewhere, Obama says, to identify it. The companies will be on board, he says, calling them \u201cpatriots.\u201d We just have to work through in many cases what are technical issues. How to square the circle on these issues is difficult.. we\u2019re also going to be in dialogue with the companies to make that work. Obama said \u201cthe biggest damage that was done\u201d from the Snowden leaks was \u201ca complete undermining of trust, some would say that was justified,\u201d in what the US government is doing surveillance-wise.\nOn the terror threat in Europe from foreign fighters and radicalized immigrants, \u201cEurope has consistently taken this seriously,\u201d Obama says. There\u2019s no doubt that the most recent events has amplified those concerns... There\u2019s always more that we can do. We can always do it better. We learn from mistakes. Each incident that occurs teaches professionals how to do it next time. \u201cThe United States has one big advantage in this whole process. It\u2019s not that our intelligence services are so much better,\u201d although they\u2019re very good, Obama says. Our biggest advantage is that our Muslim populations, they feel themselves to be Americans. There\u2019s this incredible processs of immigration and assimilation that\u2019s part of our tradition, and that\u2019s probably our greatest strength.\u201d The Boston attacks notwithstanding, he says. There are parts of Europe \u201cwhere that\u2019s not the case,\u201d Obama says. It\u2019s important that Europe not respond with a hammer, he says. He says he told Cameron all this before.\nObama contrasts \u201cCongress\u201d with \u201cpeople who actually know\u201d about Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nObama calls on CBS News. Are the leaders trying to send a message to Iran that \u201cwar footing is the next most likely\u201d result if negotiations fail? CBS\u2019 Major Garrett also asks about the terror in Paris and about cybersecurity. Obama replies first on Iran: \u201cI am not, I repeat not, suggesting that we are on immediate war footing with Iran should negotiations fail.\u201d\nObama says the US is working to identify who is trying to travel to Syria to get training and possibly return and attack the United States. Obama pushes back on the notion that the US has been passive in the conflict. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been standing on the sidelines. It\u2019s true that we did not invade Syria,\u201d he says. The assertion, he says, is that the US invading Syria would have resulted in a lesser terror threat. \u201cI\u2019ll leave it to you to play out that scenario and whether that sounds accurate,\u201d Obama says.\nCameron calls on Nic Robertson of BBC, who asks whether people are right to conclude that there may be an attack imminent on the streets of Britain. Robertson asks about the Syrian war, too, and about the economy. \u201cWe do face a very serious Islamist extremist terrorist threat in Europe and across the world,\u201d Cameron says. \u201cThat involves an incredibly long-term, patient, disciplined approach.\u201d On imminence, Cameron says: \u201cWe have a system in the UK where threat levels are set... they\u2019re not set by politicians... they\u2019ve judged that the threat is severe, that means an attack is highly likely.\u201d But if an attack were thought to be \u201cimminent\u201d, Cameron says, the threat would move up a level to the top level.\nCameron admits that he has been calling US senators to discourage them from moving to sanction Iran anew. But \u201cnot as the British prime minister\u201d telling Americans what to do, he says. ...\nObama continues: \u201cIt\u2019s my team that\u2019s at the table. We are steeped in this stuff day in and day out. We don\u2019t make these decisions blindly... I\u2019m asking Congress to hold off because... those who are most intimately involved in this assess that it will jeopardize a possibility\u201d for success. \u201cCongress needs to show patience... I will veto a bill that comes to my desk.\u201d\nIf there are new sanctions, \u201cthe likelihood of the entire negotiations failing is very high,\u201d Obama says. And if that happens, there\u2019s nothing stopping Iran from going back to trying to build a heavy-water reactor and underground facilities \u201cthat are very hard to reach militarily.\u201d He says the world needs more time to let negotiations work. \u201cThere is no good argument for us to try to undermine the negotiations until they\u2019ve played themselves out.\u201d If Iran can\u2019t get to yes, he says, \u201cI will be the first one to come to Congress and say we need to tighten the screws,\u201d and \u201call options will be on the table.\u201d Obama says if negotiations end prematurely, \u201cThe risks and likelihood that this at some point ends up being a military confrontation is heightened.\u201d\nObama turns to the sanctions program on Iran. He said the program rolled back nuclear stockpiles and provided unprecedented insight on the program. Israel agrees on this, he says. \u201cWe have not lost ground. Iran has not accelerated its program\u201d during negotiations, he says. In the coming months, the negotiations will be \u201cto determine whether or not Iran will get to yes.\u201d The world has retained remarkable unity on this, Obama says, including Russia and China. \u201cI\u2019ve always said that the chances that we can actually get a diplomatic deal are probably less than 50-50, Obama says. \u201c...But, if in fact, we still have an opportunity to get a diplomatic deal that provides us verifiable assurances that they are not developing a nuclear outcome, that is the best possible outcome.\u201d\nJon Karl at ABC gets in a third question for Obama: What do you think about the news that Mitt Romney may run for president again? Obama begins: \u201cOn your last question, I have no comment.\u201d Laughs in the room.\nABC News asks Obama why he opposes sanctions on Iran, which Cameron also said he opposes. WOuld Obama veto a sanctions bill supported by top Democrats? And for Cameron: is it correct you\u2019re calling US senators on this issue? Are you lobbying?\nHere they are, via Dan Roberts. \u201cOur alliance stands strong, rooted in our history,\u201d Cameron says.\nCameron said the US and UK face a common \u201cpoisonous\u201d enemy that wants to \u201cpervert one of the world\u2019s great religions, Islam\u201d and create conflict and terror.\nOn Ukraine, Cameron says it\u2019s important that no one in Europe \u201cforgets our history.\u201d \u201cWe cannot walk on by,\u201d he says.\nCameron said the key challenge both leaders face boils down to the word \u201csecurity.\u201d He\u2019s not just talking about terror threats. He mentions earlier economic slumps in both countries and ongoing economic risks. Cameron says the two agreed on the need for a \u201ccomprehensive EU-US trade deal\u201d in 2015.\nObama turns it over to \u201cmy good friend David Cameron.\u201d Cameron thanks him and confirms \u201cyou are my great friend and a friend to Britain.\u201d Cameron makes a joke about how \u201cmost of the time we speak the same language.\u201d\nObama said he and Cameron will do everything in their power to help France seek the \u201cjustice that is needed\u201d after the terror attacks last week. \u201cWe reviewed our coalition\u2019s progress against Isil,\u201d Obama says. He claims progress. The pair agreed to step up training of Iraqi forces. The Paris attacks underscored the threat of homegrown terrorism inspired by foreign fighters, Obama said, and the threat of returning fighters. \u201cWe both recognize that intelligence and military force alone is not going to solve this problem,\u201d Obama says. He says the two countries will continue to work on measures to prevent radicalization of young people.\nObama says the pair talked jobs and the economy, cyber-security, a deal to reduce greenhouse gasses and international security. \u201cWE agreed on the need to maintain strong sanctions against Russia until it ends\u201d its aggression in Ukraine, he says. \u201cWe agreed the international community needs to remain united in stopping Iran from achieving a nuclear weapon.\u201d \u201cWe urge the world to \u201ccontinue stepping up with the resources to fight ebola,\u201d Obama says.\nHere they are. There is a lag in the White House feed, apologies about that. It\u2019s about a ten-second lag. Obama said commentators went into a \u201ctizzy\u201d over Cameron\u2019s mention of Obama\u2019s use of the word Bro. Even speculation about what the word Bro means. \u201cLet me put this speculation to rest. Put simply David is a friend. He\u2019s one of my most trusted partners in the world.\u201d Obama thanks Cameron for his friendship. No room for humor in diplomacy, is there?\nHere come the aides with documents for the lecterns. Water glasses in place. We have a two-minute warning.\nThe White House has just released a \u201cfact sheet\u201d outlining three areas of focus for US-UK cooperation on cybersecurity. Here are the areas: Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity ...Both governments have agreed to bolster our efforts to increase threat information sharing and conduct joint cybersecurity and network defense exercises to enhance our combined ability to respond to malicious cyber activity. Our initial joint exercise will focus on the financial sector, with a program running over the coming year. ... Strengthening Cooperation on Cyber Defense ... To deepen this collaboration in other areas, the United Kingdom\u2019s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) and Security Service (MI5) are working with their U.S. partners \u2013 the National Security Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation \u2013 to further strengthen U.S.-UK collaboration on cybersecurity by establishing a joint cyber cell, with an operating presence in each country. The cell, which will allow staff from each agency to be co-located, will focus on specific cyber defense topics and enable cyber threat information and data to be shared at pace and at greater scale. Supporting Academic Research on Cybersecurity Issues The governments of both the United States and the United Kingdom have agreed to provide funding to support a new Fulbright Cyber Security Award. This program will provide an opportunity for some of the brightest scholars in both countries to conduct cybersecurity research for up to six months. The first cohort is expected to start in the 2016-17 academic year, and the U.S.-UK Fulbright Commission will seek applications for this cohort later this year.\nGuardian Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts sends a pic from inside the East Room.

The Guardian\u2019s Dominic Rushe (@dominicru) reports: Ladar Levison, founder of the encrypted email service Lavabit, made his comments as Cameron lobbied Barack Obama to press US technology companies to give law enforcement greater access to encrypted communications, following the deadly attack on the Paris office of magazine Charlie Hebdo.

Cameron has been very direct on the point, saying that tech companies \u201cneed\u201d to cooperate and have a \u201csocial responsibility\u201d to do so. He did tack on a statement about the importance of privacy in remarks he made on Monday about the need to limit privacy: \u201cThey need to work with us,\u201d Cameron said of the tech companies. \u201cThey need also to demonstrate, which they do, that they have a social responsibility to fight the battle against terrorism. We shouldn\u2019t allow safe spaces for traits to communicate. That\u2019s a huge challenge but that\u2019s certainly the right principle. \u201cOf course people want privacy in their communications. Nobody wants to listen to the phone calls or read the emails of people as they go about their daily lives.\u201d How will the American audience react to a British leader telling an American president what to tell American companies? Or maybe the receptivity to the message will surpass any chauvinistic qualms about the messenger?\nThe Obama-Cameron talks have been prompted in part by recent cyber-attacks, report the Guardian\u2019s Nicholas Watt and Patrick Wintour: The talks come as the two leaders announced a rolling programme of transatlantic cyber \u201cwar games\u201d to be conducted by British and US intelligence agencies to test their resilience in the face of mounting global cyber-attacks. Cameron told the BBC\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThis cyber-security and cyber-attacks is one of the biggest modern threats that we face. Eight out of 10 large companies in Britain have had some sort of cyber-attack against them. Britain and America working together \u2013 we have got hugely [capable] security defences and the expertise \u2013 and that is why we should combine and set up cyber cells on both sides of the Atlantic to share information, not only to work out how we best protect ourselves but create a system where hostile states and hostile organisations know they should not try to attack us.\u201d\nHello and welcome to our live coverage of a joint news conference with British prime minister David Cameron and US president Barack Obama. The appearance concludes meetings over two days between the pair. The two leaders are currently meeting in the Oval Office, joined by vice-president Joe Biden. Cybersecurity and counter-terrorism are top of the agenda. In an interview with ITV News, Cameron said he would ask Obama to step up pressure on the likes of Facebook and Twitter to do more to cooperate with intelligence agencies as they seek to track terror suspects. The pair are expected to take questions about topics including the ongoing counter-terror operations in Europe, including increased police patrols in the UK of Jewish areas and raids on Thursday in Belgium and Germany. During a Nato summit last summer, the leaders published a joint op-ed calling on the alliance to confront Isis fighters in Iraq and Syria. The sense of urgency attached to that recommendation has only grown since. We\u2019ll take a look at the latest news out of Europe as we wait for the leaders to appear.\n", "title": "Obama: 'we can do better' on surveillance programs respecting privacy \u2013 as it happened"}, {"date": "2014-06-10T18:31:06Z", "body": "Edward Snowden has secured his highest endorsement yet in the US when former vice-president Al Gore described the leaking of top secret intelligence documents as \"an important service\". Asked if he regarded Snowden as a traitor or whistleblower, Gore veered away from the \"traitor\" label. He refused to go as far as labelling him a whistleblower but signalled he viewed him as being closer to that category than a traitor, saying: \"What he revealed in the course of violating important laws included violations of the US constitution that were way more serious than the crimes he committed.\" Snowden, the former CIA and National Security Agency computer specialist, leaked US and British documents to the Guardian and Washington Post in June last year, starting a worldwide debate on the balance between surveillance and privacy. His revelations have led to proposed changes in legislation in the US and a backlash against government surveillance by major telecoms and internet companies. But he remains a polarising figure in the US. An NBC poll a fortnight ago showed 24% backing him and 34% disagreeing with his actions, with 40% having no opinion. Among the younger generation there was more support, with 32% backing him and only 20% opposed, with 47% having no opinion. Some members of Congress have welcomed the revelations but refuse to go as far as supporting Snowden, who is wanted by the US and has sought asylum in Russia. Gore, interviewed at the Southland technology conference in Nashville, Tennessee, was asked if he viewed him as a whistleblower or a traitor. \"I hear this question all the time. I'm like most people: I don't put him in either one of those categories. But I'll be candid and give you want you want. If you set up a spectrum. \" The interviewer interrupted: \"How would you define it?\" Gore replied: \"I would push it more away from the traitor side. And I will tell you why. He clearly violated the law so you can't say OK, what he did is all right. It's not. But what he revealed in the course of violating important laws included violations of the US constitution that were way more serious than the crimes he committed. \"In the course of violating important law, he also provided an important service. OK. Because we did need to know how far this has gone.\" The documents released by Snowden showed massive government surveillance but also the extent of co-operation between the government and the large telecoms and internet companies. Gore called on the internet companies to work with the public to help draw up a \"digital Magna Carta\" that provides protection of freedoms. \"They need to pay attention to correcting some of these gross abuses of individual privacy that are ongoing in the business sphere,\" he said. Snowden's hope of a return to the US is dependent on a change in a major shift in opinion that would allow him to escape a lengthy prison sentence. His supporters will seize on Gore's comments to help make the case that he is a whistleblower and should be allowed to return to the US as a free man. Ben Wizner, Snowden's US-based lawyer, said: \"Al Gore is quite obviously right. Regrettably, the laws under which Snowden is being charged make no allowance for the value of the information he disclosed. Whether the NSA's activities violated the law or the constitution would be irrelevant in a trial under the Espionage Act.\"\n", "title": "Edward Snowden's NSA leaks 'an important service', says Al Gore"}, {"date": "2016-11-05T02:27:49Z", "body": "On the eve of the final friday before the presidential election, the candidates are focusing their attention on key swing states. Clinton held a get-out-the-vote rally in Cleveland, Ohio, alongside Beyonce, Jay Z, and Chance the Rapper Trump spoke to a packed crowd in a hockey arena in Hershey, Pennsylvania At his rally, he said that Obama had screamed at a protester, when in fact Obama had told his crowd not to boo the man at a rally in North Carolina The Wall Street Journal revealed that the National Enquirer paid $150,000 for a story about an affair between Trump and a Playboy model just to kill the story to protect his campaign The Associated Press revealed that Melania Trump worked illegally as a model in the US before obtaining her work visa Earlier, a judge in Ohio issued a temporary restraining order against members of the Trump campaign to prevent them from intimidating voters at polling-places Earlier, Trump campaigned in Wilmington, Ohio and Clinton in Detroit, Michigan\n\u201cLet\u2019s send an unmistakeable message that love.

What an incredible show.\u201d\nThat comment has some history. NPR reports: Every presidential election cycle since 1992, the magazine has published a cookie recipe from the candidates\u2019 wives. The latest recipes were released Thursday morning, of course with a twist this year: Since Hillary Clinton is the first female nominee of a major party, it was her husband, Bill, who was asked to furnish a cookie recipe, along with Melania Trump. The Clintons don\u2019t exactly win points for creativity this year. The campaign submitted the \u201cClinton Family\u2019s Chocolate Chip Cookies\u201d \u2014 a reprise of Hillary Clinton\u2019s earlier oatmeal chocolate chip submissions. And Melania Trump\u2019s submission: \u201cMelania Trump\u2019s Star Cookies.\u201d Family Circle readers will vote on the recipes in a poll on the magazine\u2019s website. But this isn\u2019t so much a story about cookies as it is a story about Hillary Clinton. Back in 1992, Hillary Clinton was something of an oddity, a political spouse with her own high-powered career, who hadn\u2019t set it aside to stand by her husband when Bill Clinton became governor of Arkansas. Her career became an issue in the Democratic primary. There were questions about whether then-Gov. Bill Clinton had funneled state business into her law firm. When asked about her career in a press gaggle, Clinton responded, \u201cYou know, I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided to do was to fulfill my profession, which I entered before my husband was in public life. And I tried very, very hard to be as careful as possible, and that\u2019s all that I can tell you.\u201d\nSome video of Beyonce\u2019s arrival in Cleveland:\n\u201cThere was a time a woman\u2019s opinion did not matter,\u201d Beyonce says. \u201cLess than 100 years ago women did not have the right to vote.

The documents provide the most detailed accounting yet of Mrs. Trump\u2019s first months in the U.S. She has said she followed all immigration laws as she moved from Slovenia to New York in August 1996 and obtained a work visa about seven weeks later. The documents show she was paid for 10 modeling assignments between Sept. 10 and Oct. 15, before she would have been legally allowed to be paid.

He says that under his healthcare plan, \u201cit\u2019s gonna cost less and you\u2019re gonna get really good stuff, let me tell you.\u201d\nHe is speaking to a packed crowd at the Giant Center in Hershey, Pennsylvania.\nHe was introduced by his campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, as well as RNC chair Reince Priebus, who said that America is in a \u201cfight for freedom\u201d. At one point, when the crowd was chanting \u201cCNN sucks\u201d, Conway shushed them. \u201cBe nice,\u201d she said. That\u2019s a first at one of these events.\nWhile we wait for Trump in Pennsylvania, Obama is in Charlotte, North Carolina campaigning for Hillary Clinton:\nA new poll from ABC News and the Washington Post puts Clinton in the lead:\nA local North Carolina Republican headquarters was spray-painted with an anti-Donald Trump message early on Friday, the second time in a month that a party office in the state has been defaced, reports Reuters. A vandal sprayed the door and walls of the Alamance County Republican Party headquarters in Burlington with the words \u201cFuck Trump\u201d and painted over the word \u201cRepublican\u201d on a sign at the office at about 2 a.m. local time, according to Chris Verdeck, assistant police chief in the city. No arrests have been made in the incident, which was caught on surveillance video footage, Verdeck said in a phone interview. The vandalism in Burlington, which is located about 20 miles east of Greensboro, occurred four days before the U.S. presidential election on Tuesday.

Robert Satiacum, a member of Washington\u2019s Puyallup Tribe, supported Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary. He said he believes Clinton is a \u201ccriminal\u201d who doesn\u2019t care enough about American Indians and \u201cshe\u2019s done nothing but flip back and forth.\u201d He said he has wrestled with what to do, but feels that neither Clinton nor Republican Donald Trump can lead the country. \u201cShe will not get my vote, period,\u201d he said in a phone interview with The Associated Press. Americans vote for the president, but they\u2019re really casting votes for each state\u2019s electors, who will decide the next president on Dec. 19. In all but two states, the winner of the state\u2019s popular vote gets all of the state\u2019s electors. There\u2019s nothing in the Constitution that says the electors are required to vote for a particular candidate, but some states have penalties for so-called \u201cfaithless electors.\u201d Satiacum faces a $1,000 fine in Washington if he doesn\u2019t vote for Clinton, but he said he doesn\u2019t care.\nAs if this election cycle couldn\u2019t get any weirder, time to address the key question from today\u2019s politics: is Clinton adviser John Podesta a practictioner of occult sex magic? Wikileaks released an email forwarded by his brother Tony from summer 2015 in which Podesta was invited to a dinner party hosted by Marina Abramovic which she described as \u201cSpirit Cooking\u201d. Several leaps later, Drudge Report was leading with the headline \u201cWiki Wiccan: Podesta Practices Occult Magic\u201d. Wait. What happened? The Washington Post has done a deep dive looking at how the right-wing media made the jump to witchcraft, based on art installations Abramovic has made. They even point out that another email released by Wikileaks shows that Podesta never even attended the dinner. Abramovi\u0107\u2019s mention of \u201cSpirit Cooking\u201d appears to refer to her 1996 artwork that consists of a book with recipes \u201cthat serve as evocative instructions for actions or thoughts,\u201d according to the Museum of Modern Art\u2019s gallery label describing it. The recipes range from the implausible to the impossible. One calls for \u201c13,000 grams of jealousy.\u201d Another instructs you to stand \u201con top of a volcano\u201d and open your mouth \u201cuntil your tongue becomes flame.\u201d Another \u2014 the one that seems to be generating the most interest among conspiracy theorists \u2014 says to \u201cmix fresh breast milk with fresh sperm milk.\u201d But the right-wing blogosphere, led by Wikileaks, jumped on the blood bandwagon:\nSean Hannity, and Drudge, both picked up the story, as did the Trump-supporting Twitterverse.\nSo that\u2019s why today\u2019s Twitter has been brought to you by Wicca, in case you were wondering.\nAt Trump\u2019s rally, the crowd seems fired-up. A man was just shouting \u201cMEDIA SUCKS\u201d at the camera crews as they wait for the Republican presidential nominee to take the stage.\nThe woman who accused Trump of raping her two decades ago, when she was 13, has dropped her federal lawsuit over the alleged assaults, Politico is reporting. The accuser, identified in the suit by the pseudonym \u201cJane Doe,\u201d was expected to appear at a news conference in Los Angeles Wednesday, but that appearance was abruptly canceled. The lawyer who organized the event, Lisa Bloom, said Trump\u2019s accuser had received threats and was too frightened to show up. In the most recent suit, Trump\u2019s accuser asserted that while she was exploring a modeling career in 1994, she attended a series of parties at the Manhattan home of prominent investor Jeffrey Epstein. She alleges that during those parties the real estate mogul raped her on several occasions, including one instance in which she says Trump tied her to a bed. She also claimed Epstein raped her during those parties. The accuser\u2019s lead attorney, Thomas Meagher of New Jersey, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. He filed a one-page notice dismissing the case Friday evening in federal court in Manhattan. No explanation was given for the action.

Stay with us.\nNew York has increased its terrorism alert status after the FBI announced that it is investigating intelligence that suggested al-Qaeda may be plotting attacks before Tuesday\u2019s general election, according to CBS News, citing anonymous sources within the FBI. Federal and local counterterrorism officials have gone on high alert following news of the threat. The FBI and the NYPD have declared that they are currently assessing the credibility of the threats, which were vague and named no specific targets but reportedly mentioned New York, Texas or Virginia. \u201cWe are already on a state of high alert for election day, so we have more state police, more national guard, more soldiers on duty than ever before,\u201d said New York governor Andrew Cuomo in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re co-ordinating with the NYPD, so, there\u2019s bad news and good news. Bad news is that New York is often a threat, the good news is that we\u2019ve been living with this now for a decade, and we got prepared for it, and drilled for it, we take every threat seriously, so we\u2019ll be prepared and we\u2019ll be ready.\u201d\nScott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin, is tweeting about sandwiches again:\nDonald Trump and Hillary Clinton prepared to blitz five battleground states between them on Friday, with four days remaining until American voters will choose their next president. Clinton began the day with a rally in Pennsylvania, a state where she holds a consistent lead over Trump, while the Republican nominee made a last-minute push in New Hampshire. Trump has surged in recent days in the Granite State, where he scored his first victory of the Republican primary contest earlier this year. Clinton\u2019s long-held lead in New Hampshire has collapsed in recent days. She was shown trailing Trump or tied with him in four new public polls taken in the wake of the letter from the FBI director, James Comey, informing Congress that it was possible new emails had been discovered related to the investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server. The news has helped ensure that a number of Republicans and libertarians previously skeptical about Trump have now rallied around the nominee. Former New Hampshire governor John Sununu predicted before Trump appeared there on Friday that the margin for the winning candidate could come down to 5,000 votes. Clinton\u2019s campaign announced that she would hold a rally in Manchester on Sunday, in a sign of the state\u2019s renewed competitiveness in the final stretch. Barack Obama will campaign in the state on Clinton\u2019s behalf the day before the election. Although New Hampshire only provides four electoral votes, a win there would greatly aid Trump as he navigates a narrow path to victory.\nUpset with how the main broadcast networks have covered your preferred candidate?

Telling the audience that America is a country that respects free speech, Obama called on voters not to get distracted by the animosity of the election cycle and instead keep focused on ensuring Trump does not win.\nWatch it here:\nThe Democratic National Committee informed the FBI that it suspected that its national headquarters had been bugged by parties unknown, according to a Mother Jones report citing two anonymous members of the DNC. The potential bugging, a callback to the Watergate break-in, was discovered during a security sweep of the party\u2019s national headquarters in Washington, DC, where a radio signal discovered near the office of the party\u2019s chair \u201cindicated there might be a listening device outside the office,\u201d Mother Jones reports. \u201cWe were told that this was something that could pick up calls from cell phones,\u201d a DNC official told Mother Jones. \u201cThe guys who did the sweep said it was a strong indication.\u201d \u201cAs a general policy, we don\u2019t talk about such efforts,\u201d another DNC official told Mother Jones, but \u201cwe are the oldest political party in this country, and we are under constant attack from Russia and/or maybe others.\u201d DNC spokesman Adam Hodge told Mother Jones that the party would not comment on security concerns. \u201cThe DNC is not going to comment on stories about its security,\u201d Hodge said. \u201cIn all security matters, we cooperate fully with the appropriate law enforcement agencies and take all necessary steps to protect the committee and the safety and security of our staff.\u201d\nDonald Trump, on emails: Some of those emails are so bad, they\u2019re beyond classified.\nSpeaking at an airplane hanger in Wilmington, Ohio, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump vowed to \u201cwin the great state of Ohio, and we are going to win back the White House!\u201d Telling the audience that his campaign is about \u201crestoring honesty to government,\u201d Trump falsely alleged that the FBI has \u201cmultiple open investigations\u201d into opponent Hillary Clinton, but that the system has a way of \u201cflushing itself out.\u201d \u201cHillary is now facing major problems with perjury,\u201d Trump said, incorrectly, calling Clinton the Justice Department\u2019s \u201cangel.\u201d \u201cHillary has engaged in a criminal massive enterprise,\u201d Trump continued, \u201clike probably nobody ever before.\u201d\nWatch it live here:\nA coalition of young people and minority constituencies are helping Hillary Clinton build a \u201cfirewall\u201d against Donald Trump key states, the campaign said this afternoon as the race tightens in the final days of the election. Campaign manager Robby Mook told reporters on a conference call that early voter turnout in Florida, North Carolina and Nevada is showing positive signs for the campaign. In these battleground states, the campaign is working to cement a lead that Trump is \u201cincapable of overcoming\u201d.\n\u201cIf he hasn\u2019t banked his base by this point, he\u2019s going to have an even taller task in these last few days before the election, without a ground game to turn those voters out,\u201d Mook said on the call. Mook said Clinton is winning support from what they call the \u201cHillary coalition\u201d: millennials, African Americans, Latinos, Asians and college-educated white women. Mook said turnout among Latinos is up 120% in Florida, and with five days left already outpacing the overall turnout in 2012. The African American turnout there is up by 22% from 2012 despite overall figures showing a slump in black turnout rates nationally. In North Carolina, African American turnout lagged behind 2012 figures, though the number of Latinos voting early rose from the last election, the campaign said. In Nevada, Mook said more than 40% of registered voters have already cast ballots and that turnout among Latinos and Asian Americans is outpacing 2012. There he said Trump is underperforming Republican nominee Mitt Romney was in 2012. \u201cTrump is going to need to outperform Romney on Election Day in all three of states to be successful,\u201d he said. The campaign\u2019s strategy has been to target unlikely voters in an effort of building up an early lead in these states. Mook said Trump would have to improve on Romney\u2019s 2012 performance in order to win there. Mook again stated that the campaign believes \u201cthis will be the highest turnout election we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d which he interpreted as a positive sign for Democrats.\nAn Ohio judge has issued a temporary restraining order against members of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign to prevent them from intimidating voters in the Buckeye State after the filing of a lawsuit that alleged Trump\u2019s campaign, in cahoots with a GOP operative and his political action committee, were conspiring to suppress minority votes in the state. US District Judge James Gwin ruled in a lawsuit filed by the Ohio Democratic Party that any members of Trump\u2019s campaign or affiliated with Roger Stone\u2019s Pac would face contempt-of-court charges, according to Cleveland.com. The order will be written in a party-neutral manner, Gwin said in his ruling. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be any attempt to particularly identify as somebody being a Trump supporter or not,\u201d Gwin said. The lawsuit, filed on Sunday, claimed that Trump\u2019s comments in Akron on August 22 - \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get everybody to go out and watch, and go out and vote. And when I say \u2018watch,\u2019 you know what I\u2019m talking about, right?\u201d - were a tacit bid to convince his supporters to suppress minority turnout.\nJohn Podesta, on the Bridgegate convictions: Rather than just... talking about cleaning up the swamp, he might start by draining his own swamp and asking Mr. Christie to resign as the head of his transition.\nHow could you reclaim a meme that\u2019s been appropriated by white supremacists? That\u2019s the challenge faced by Pepe the Frog\u2019s creator Matt Furie. Furie has launched the #SavePepe campaign in an attempt to transform the cartoon frog from a symbol of hate used by racist Donald Trump supporters to a symbol of peace. He\u2019s urging people to flood the internet with their own \u201cpeaceful or nice\u201d versions of Pepe to claw the character back from the alt-right. \u201cWe are in uncharted territory right now,\u201d said Furie, an artist and author of children\u2019s books as well as a Hillary Clinton supporter, \u201cBut I have to take some responsibility for him because he\u2019s like my kid or something.\u201d\nFurie created Pepe back in 2005 as one of four anthropomorphic characters in a comic book called Boy\u2019s Club to amuse his friends at work. \u201cThe frog was just a chilled-out frog who likes to eat snacks and talk on the phone, smoke weed,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the characters are an extension of different parts of my personality, but particularly Pepe. He has these heavy eyelids and laid-back nature that I think I have.\u201d Pepe first became a meme in around 2008. People were lifting frames from the comic book, particularly one where Pepe has pulled his pants all the way down to pee and says \u201cfeels good, man\u201d and another where Pepe is consoling himself about his lack of success with women, saying \u201cat least I have time for a pizza on a bagel\u201d and adding their own captions. \u201cThen the Sad Frog took off,\u201d said Furie, referencing a meme that flipped \u201cfeels good man\u201d on its head. \u201cIt just started to have a life of its own. All these versions of Pepe having different personalities \u2013 smug, sad or really violent and weird,\u201d said Furie, citing a \u201cscatological and weirdly graphic\u201d version known as Poo Poo Pee Pee Pepe [NSFW]. Pepe\u2019s success was international, and he won major followings in China and Korea. \u201cPepe transcends all these kind of sociological boundaries. He\u2019s just a cartoon frog that\u2019s sad and people can relate to that.\u201d That all changed on 12 September, when Hillary Clinton posted an explainer about Pepe the Frog becoming a racist hate symbol. Over the previous few weeks, Pepe had been appropriated by the alt-right and was being used as a mascot for white supremacy by some Trump supporters. Two weeks later, Pepe was added to the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s database of hate symbols, joining the swastika, the triangular Klan symbol and other iconography associated with racism.\nFinishing a barn-burner of a speech in Fayetteville, North Carolina, President Barack Obama framed the upcoming general election as an opportunity for those who have supported him over the past eight years to help cement his legacy. \u201cIt isn\u2019t that often where in your life you\u2019ve got a chance to move history,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that often where you have the chance to bend the arc of history in the direction of justice. It\u2019s not that often where you know you can make a difference. This is one of those moments.\u201d \u201cYou have a chance to shape history! Don\u2019t let that slip away! Don\u2019t fall for the easy cynicism that tells you, \u2018politics doesn\u2019t matter, my vote doesn\u2019t matter,\u2019\u201d Obama continued. \u201cIf you\u2019ve been marching for criminal justice reform, that\u2019s great, but you need to vote!\u201d he said, in a call-and-response riff. \u201cIf you care about making sure our veterans get treated fairly, that\u2019s great, but you need to vote!\u201d \u201cIf you vote, we\u2019ll win North Carolina. And if we win North Carolina, Hillary Clinton will be president,\u201d Obama concluded. \u201cUnderstand the stakes here - my name\u2019s not on the ballot, but everything we\u2019ve worked for is on the ballot! Justice is on the ballot! Equality is on the ballot! Jobs are on the ballot! Healthcare\u2019s on the ballot! Criminal justice reform\u2019s on the ballot! Democracy\u2019s on the ballot! I need you to vote!\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t choose fear - choose hope.\u201d\nPresident Barack Obama, on voter suppression: Right now, Donald Trump is calling on his supporters to monitor \u2018certain areas\u2019 on Election Day. I don\u2019t know what \u2018certain areas\u2019 he\u2019s talking about. But you do.\nPresident Barack Obama, on government dysfunction: Come on! You can\u2019t do that! That ain\u2019t right! Not only is it not right, but it ain\u2019t right!\nSpeaking on Hillary Clinton\u2019s behalf in Fayetteville, North Carolina, President Barack Obama told a large college-aged audience that unlike Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton doesn\u2019t need Lithuania pointed out on a map - and that she made him a better president. \u201cShe made me a better president,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWhen things don\u2019t go her way, she doesn\u2019t whine. she doesn\u2019t complain, she doesn\u2019t blame somebody else, she doesn\u2019t say the game is rigged - she just works harder, comes back stronger, gets up when she gets knocked down, dusts herself, and keeps on going.\u201d \u201cShe will be a strong and a steady president,\u201d Obama continued.\nSpeaking in North Carolina, President Barack Obama framed Donald Trump as \u201cuniquely unqualified\u201d to hold the office of the presidency, pointing out that Trump\u2019s rhetoric and behavior runs counter to lessons that any parent teaches their children. \u201cNobody\u2019s higher than you, but nobody\u2019s lower than you. You don\u2019t lift yourselves higher by putting somebody else down,\u201d Obama said, citing qualities he has instilled in his own daughters. \u201cWe can\u2019t have a president who, ever day, seems to violate those basic values. The problem is that he\u2019s done it so much that it\u2019s become almost normal. It\u2019s like suddenly reality TV has entered into the race for the presidency.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not even Survivor or The Bachelorette - it\u2019s like some Love and Hip-Hop stuff!\u201d The largely African-American audience laughed loudly at that one. \u201cCome on, man!\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t be thinking, somehow, that just because he agrees with you on some policy issue, or just because you\u2019re frustrated with government that it\u2019s okay to display the kind of behavior that he displays!\u201d Obama said. \u201cWho you are, what you are does not change once you become president. It will magnify who you are. You have more power, so as a consequence, folks will enable you to be more who you are. It will shine a spotlight on who you are.\u201d \u201cIf you accept the support of Klan sympathizers, if you don\u2019t denounce them right away because you\u2019re not sure, well, then that\u2019s what you\u2019re gonna do when you\u2019re in office,\u201d Obama continued. \u201cYes, I am a proud Democrat, but we\u2019re not Democrats or Republicans first - we\u2019re children of God first. We are Americans first. We are human beings first. I\u2019ve got Republican friends who don\u2019t think or act the way Donald Trump is acting, and as a consequence, they\u2019re not voting for him.\u201d \u201cThis is somebody different - uniquely unqualified to do the job,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut you know something, North Carolina? You are all uniquely qualified to make sure he doesn\u2019t get the job!\u201d\nCalling Donald Trump \u201cuniquely unqualified\u201d and \u201ctemperamentally unfit\u201d to be president of the United States, President Barack Obama was interrupted by a deafening \u201cHillary!\u201d chant after an elderly veteran appeared to protest during his address. After a few minutes of din, during which the president put on his best substitute-teacher hat to calm the crowd down. \u201cYou\u2019ve got an older gentleman who is supporting his candidate - he\u2019s not doin\u2019 nothin\u2019. You don\u2019t have to worry about him,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe live in a country that respects free speech.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t boo - vote!\u201d\nPresident Barack Obama, campaigning on Hillary Clinton\u2019s behalf at Fayetteville State University in Fayetteville, North Carolina, tells the audience of college-aged voters that \u201cwe\u2019ve got some business to do.\u201d \u201cThe good news is that you don\u2019t have to wait \u2019til election day to vote!\u201d Obama said. \u201cYou have until tomorrow to register and vote at any one-stop location in your county - and there\u2019s one less than a half-mile away from here.\u201d Obama framed the election in four days as a referendum that will decide the future of his legacy as president - one that Clinton would protect and expand. \u201cThere is only one candidate in this race in 2016 who has devoted her life to helping to build that better America, and that\u2019s the next president of the United States: Hillary Rodham Clinton!\u201d \u201cBut we can\u2019t take it for granted - we can\u2019t be complacent,\u201d Obama continued. \u201cAll the progress that we\u2019ve made these last eight years goes out the window if we don\u2019t win this election. So we\u2019ve got to work our hearts out this week, these last four days, as if our future depends on it. Because our future depends on it!\u201d\nWatch it here live:\nMoments before President Barack Obama is due to make a campaign appearance on Hillary Clinton\u2019s behalf in North Carolina:\nHere\u2019s a live stream of Barack Obama\u2019s upcoming event for Hillary Clinton in Fayetteville, NC:\nTrump surrogate Rudy Giuliani, the former NYC mayor, said on Fox this morning that he knew in advance of a new FBI inquiry announced last week into emails relating to Hillary Clinton:\nRead Spencer Ackerman\u2019s piece from Thursday, \u201cThe FBI is Trumpland\u201d: Deep antipathy to Hillary Clinton exists within the FBI, multiple bureau sources have told the Guardian, spurring a rapid series of leaks damaging to her campaign just days before the election. Current and former FBI officials, none of whom were willing or cleared to speak on the record, have described a chaotic internal climate that resulted from outrage over director James Comey\u2019s July decision not to recommend an indictment over Clinton\u2019s maintenance of a private email server on which classified information transited. \u201cThe FBI is Trumpland,\u201d said one current agent.\nAnother day closer to the presidential election, another slew of surveys \u2013 most of them showing that Hillary Clinton is in the lead. But the size of the Democratic candidate\u2019s advantage varies considerably from poll to poll, partly because some questionnaires ask voters to consider the fact that there are more than two presidential nominees. Green party candidate Jill Stein is on the ballot in 45 states and voters in another three states can choose to write her name in. And the Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson is on the ballot in 50 states. Progressives who are feeling turned off by Clinton and/or Donald Trump, the two most unpopular candidates in decades, might be considering a protest vote for one of these other parties (\u201cprotest\u201d in the sense that third-party candidates have a less than 0.1% chance of winning). With just four days to go until the election, they might be wondering who will be hindered more by a protest vote \u2013 Democrat Clinton or Republican Trump? As with all of the articles I have written so far about polling data, the answer is a very unsexy \u201cit depends\u201d. The impact of protest votes varies throughout the country. Read further:\nDonald Trump is making a last-minute push in New Hampshire, where he has surged in polls in recent days and where he scored his first victory of the Republican primary contest earlier this year. Here\u2019s a report on the state of the race by Ben Jacobs in Atkinson, New Hampshire, and Sabrina Siddiqui in Pittsburgh: Former New Hampshire governor John Sununu predicted before Trump appeared there on Friday that the margin for the winning candidate could come down to 5,000 votes.\nClinton\u2019s campaign announced that she would hold a rally in Manchester on Sunday, in a sign of the state\u2019s renewed competitiveness in the final stretch. Barack Obama will campaign in the state on Clinton\u2019s behalf the day before the election. Clinton embarked on a packed itinerary Friday, with plans to hit three battlegrounds in one day. The Democratic nominee began with a rally in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where thousands formed a line that snaked around the stadium of the Pittsburgh Steelers, the city\u2019s football team. She was introduced there by Mark Cuban, the influential businessman and investor who hails from Pittsburgh and has been a prominent backer of Clinton\u2019s. Cuban has repeatedly taunted Trump while stumping for Clinton, and continued to take shots at the Republican nominee in his remarks on Friday.\n\u201cYou cannot be president of the United States if you don\u2019t know when to shut up,\u201d Cuban said. He then led a call and response with the crowd, posing questions of Trump that ranged from his trustworthiness to his wealth. \u201cDo you think he cares more about you or his bank account?\u201d Cuban said. \u201cBank account!\u201d they chanted back. Upon taking the stage to a raucous crowd, Clinton sought to contrast her economic agenda with that of Trump. She struck familiar themes about her opponent stiffing his own workers, while touting her plans to introduce 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave, enact equal pay for women, raise the minimum wage and expand access to affordable childcare. Her closing argument was not simply policy-driven, however, leaning heavily on Trump\u2019s volatile persona and what that would mean for the country under his stewardship. \u201cThink about what it would mean to entrust the nuclear codes to someone with a very thin skin, who lashes out at anyone who challenges him,\u201d Clinton said, prompting audience members to break into shouts of \u201cNo!\u201d \u201cImagine how easily it could be that Donald Trump would feel insulted and start a real war, not just a Twitter war, at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning.\u201d From Pittsburgh, she was scheduled to move on to Detroit, Michigan, and Cleveland, Ohio, the latter of which was billed as a get out the vote concert with rapper Jay-Z. Aides aboard Clinton\u2019s press plane downplayed rumors that Beyonce would join her husband at the event, saying only there would be special guests at the highly-anticipated event. Clinton was accompanied on Friday by a heavier staff presence, with at least eight top aides spotted boarding her plane.\nThe Guardian\u2019s Sabrina Siddiqui lends Clinton an ear:\n(Ben\u2019s kidding. We think.)\nWe\u2019re sick of Cuban\u2019s acronym. How can Trump close in Pennsylvania?\nCuban is doing an acronym with Trump\u2019s name with the word \u201cTrust.\u201d Each letter of Trump\u2019s name stands for something bad that defines the candidate, in Cuban\u2019s conceit. Oh that\u2019s why they brought Cuban to Pittsburgh \u2013 he\u2019s from the P-burgh suburb of Squirrel Hill, he says.

Those people were terminated by me and today, the jury affirms that decision by also holding them responsible for their own conduct. Like so many people in New Jersey, I\u2019m saddened by this case and I\u2019m saddened about the choices made by Bill Baroni, Bridget Kelly and David Wildstein. Today\u2019s verdict does not change this for me. But let me be clear once again, I had no knowledge prior to or during these lane realignments, and had no role in authorizing them. No believable evidence was presented to contradict that fact. Anything said to the contrary over the past six weeks in court is simply untrue. As a former federal prosecutor, I have respected these proceedings and refused to comment on the daily testimony from the trial. I will set the record straight in the coming days regarding the lies that were told by the media and in the courtroom.\nIn which journalist Brian Williams asks journalist Mark Halperin, who has produced some aggressively non-confrontational coverage of Donald Trump (see below), about what color the sky is in Trumpland, and Halperin loses the struggle to maintain anodyne TV face:\nThe Trump campaign has issued a statement in the name of Dr Darrell Scott, a Cleveland pastor, criticizing Hillary Clinton\u2019s planned appearance at a rally tonight with Jay-Z (and Beyonc\u00e9? maybe?). \u201cFor all of her talk about fighting for kids, [Clinton] has no problem sharing a stage with someone who glamorizes acts of violence and having pushed drugs in our local communities,\u201d Scott\u2019s statement says. (Read more about him and his controversial support for Trump.)\nThe line of criticism is reminiscent of the Trump surrogate who last month read Beyonc\u00e9 lyrics on CNN in an effort to... well just watch:\nThe lyrics are from the song Formation: When he fuck me good, I take his ass to Red Lobster (cause I slay) When he fuck me good, I take his ass to Red Lobster (we gon slay) If he hit it right, I might take him on a flight on my chopper (I slay) Drop him off at the mall, let him buy some J\u2019s, let him shop up (\u2019cause I slay)\nAhead of election day, we\u2019ve been asking those who have volunteered to work the polls to get in touch and tell us about their experiences and thoughts about participating. Responses have arrived from first-time volunteers and poll worker veterans alike, with a common theme throughout: They\u2019ve heard Donald Trump\u2019s warnings of a \u201crigged\u201d election, and want to share their two cents. (Curious about the difference between a poll worker and a poll monitor? Learn more, here.) I\u2019ve been an election officer in Delaware for six election cycles, a total of 16 primaries, national, or local elections. We have never denied a person the right to vote; we want people to vote... We\u2019ve never been informed that a voter\u2019s ballot was deemed irregular, suspect, or invalid. That\u2019s zero out of almost 20,000. \u2014Robert, 67, Delaware My poll-worker training class was filled with well-intentioned and attentive people. But there is a lot to learn in that 4 hours and from what I can tell, significant room in our voting system for human error... My class was packed, around 50 people, and many trainees were lost or behind. It would\u2019ve been impossible for the trainer to make sure everyone was following. Overall, it was heartening to see so many people interested in the election process, but disappointing to see how antiquated, underfunded, and messy our process truly is. \u2014Sophia, 23, New York I have a full-time position, but am happy to give up 14 hours of my time on Election Day to the cause of civic participation... I am, however, extremely uneasy with Trump\u2019s rhetoric encouraging unlicensed \u201cpoll watchers.\u201d I took poll worker training at the county courthouse last week, where we were given the run-down on legal and illegal forms of poll watching and how to deal with it if we experience the latter form... We were told in training that Kansas polling locations until Jan. 2017 prohibit the carrying of firearms, and that any who carry them can be forced to leave immediately. I know, however, that I will not be volunteering to tell someone with a gun to leave the premises. \u2014Warren, 30, Kansas Are you planning to volunteer as a poll worker?

Plus one son.\nWhat if Chris Christie had been Donald Trump\u2019s running mate?\nThough Pence is a public face of the ticket, Christie has been part of Trump\u2019s circle in a way Pence never has. Christie was one of the first high-profile Republicans to publicly back Trump\u2019s candidacy, advised him on debate strategy, campaign strategy, personnel strategy, rounded up lobbyists and donors, took charge of his transition team... The Guardian\u2019s David Smith wrote in September: Christie has not been charged over the bridge imbroglio, but questions linger over how much he knew and it dealt a major blow to his own presidential hopes. In a Republican primary debate last December, when Christie said he would order US forces to shoot down Russian aircraft over Syria, rival Rand Paul shot back: \u201cWhen we think about the judgment of someone who might want world war three, we might think about someone who might shut down a bridge because they don\u2019t like their friends.\u201d Now the timing of the trial is a headache that Trump, already mired in numerous controversies, could do without in the last stretch of the presidential election.\n\u201cI have known and liked Chris for 15 years,\u201d Trump told the Times in September, as the trial just concluded heated up. \u201cAfter his recent run for president, he called me to say that he would like to endorse me in that he sees a movement like he has never seen before. I was greatly honored, accepted his endorsement, and he has been a spectacular advocate ever since.\u201d\nTestimony in the Bridgegate trial indicated that Christie, the New Jersey governor, knew about the bridge lane closures at the time, which he has denied. It\u2019s not clear what legal jeopardy he may be in, if any. But two of his closest allies (formerly) were just convicted on criminal charges in federal court.\nWill Farrell works to get out the millennial vote.

The Asbury Park Press describes the charges: Kelly and Baroni are fighting charges they worked together to close access lanes to the [George Washington] bridge to punish Mark Sokolich, the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, for not endorsing Christie for re-election in 2013.

Today\u2019s Friday and the election\u2019s on Tuesday. That\u2019s soon. You read it here first. Donald Trump is not giving up on Pennsylvania. His last event of the work week is scheduled to take place in Hershey, in Dauphin County, which Barack Obama won by six points in 2012 \u2013 better than his statewide average. Pennsylvania is a big prize. It awards 20 electoral votes \u2013 gives them every time to the Democrats, in fact, going back six elections. It would be a great win for Trump. But he appears to be losing there. We don\u2019t know what his internal polling says. Here\u2019s what the publicly available polling says:\nEarlier Friday, Trump will head to Atkinson, New Hampshire, where polls released on Thursday had him looking good. He also will campaign outside Cincinnati in Ohio. Hillary Clinton will hold rallies in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (she\u2019s not taking Pennsylvania for granted) and in Detroit, Michigan, today before heading to Cleveland for a Jay Z concert that also will feature, we think, Beyonc\u00e9. Speaking of Beyonc\u00e9, this is weird!\nBarack Obama has two rallies planned for Clinton in North Carolina. Bernie Sanders is to speak three times in Iowa and once in Omaha, Nebraska, where Clinton just might pick up an electoral vote. Tim Kaine is in Florida, Bill Clinton is in Colorado and Chelsea Clinton is in New Hampshire. Let\u2019s catch up with the Trump sons. Donald Trump Jr is in Phoenix, Arizona, and in New Mexico today, while Eric Trump is running the leather off his shoes in Michigan, hitting something like seven cities. Run, Eric, run! A hint of polling\nClinton stumps with Sanders, Pharrell Williams On Thursday evening Clinton was joined in Raleigh by former rival, Bernie Sanders and the singer Pharrell Williams. The trio appeared before a raucous crowd of about 5,200 people at an outdoor amphitheater, where Sanders drew an especially strong response from the largely young crowd, who broke into chants of \u201cBernie\u201d. The Democratic nominee largely let her surrogates argue for her, underscoring the Vermont senator\u2019s continued popularity among a demographic with which Clinton has struggled. \u201cThis is not a personality contest,\u201d Sanders implored voters. \u201cWe\u2019re not voting for high school president. We\u2019re voting for the most powerful leader in the world.\u201d Sanders told the crowd that Trump represented an unacceptable option, and that the \u201ccornerstone\u201d of his campaign was bigotry. \u201cWe are not going back to a bigoted society,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to allow Trump or anyone else to divide us up.\u201d\nThanks for reading and please join us in the comments. \ud83d\ude33\n", "title": "Trump campaign hit with restraining order over voter intimidation fears \u2013 as it happened"}, {"date": "2013-09-10T06:30:00Z", "body": "A burst of 9 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team Govt. violates privacy safeguards to secretly monitor Internet traffic >> The Hindu Shalini Singh: Amid fresh controversy following reports of the U.S.'s Prism programme targeting the Brazilian President, and the impending launch of the Indian government's own Central Monitoring System (CMS) project, an investigation by The Hindu reveals that the Internet activities of India's roughly 160 million users are already being subjected to wide-ranging surveillance and monitoring, much of which is in violation of the government's own rules and notifications for ensuring \"privacy of communications\".

Android favors piracy >> spin \u00bd Amit Jain: Google has an inherent incentive in keeping piracy alive. It makes Android a much more attractive option in developing nations and earns Google users, a lot, lot, of users. This certainly cuts into developer returns, who are then forced to resort to ads.

And, that is good enough for Google. Surface RT 2: Tegra 4, 1080P screen, and more >> Neowin If you are curious about what the features will be for the upcoming Surface RT 2, likely to be called just the Surface, the device will be equipped with a Tegra 4 CPU, 1080P screen, two-step style kickstand and we are also hearing the RAM will get bumped to 4GB too.\u00a0We are not sure if the RAM bump will be like that of the Surface Pro 2 that may include models that have either 4GB or 8GB. These updates will result in a modest bump to the specs to the Surface RT and will help keep the tablet running Windows RT 8.1 with ease. These updates are clearly a evolutionary step for the Surface RT family and is by no means a complete re-write of the device. We will be curious to see what the price point is when Microsoft releases the device to see if they stick with the $349 price or if they return to the initial MSRP of $499. Two-step kickstand might be the best improvement. None of the rest matters; they aren't the reason why the Surface RT didn't sell.

The bar code on the iPad mini 2 case is the exact same one that appears on the DBW Electronics Co.'s Alibaba page. The. Exact. Same. One. Heck, some of\u00a0the photos are the exact same if you dig around long enough, with the only exception being that the official DBW Electronics Co.'s images had watermarks on Alibaba. Maybe DBW got the parts from the factory workers that Dickson cites, then DBW built prototypes and is then selling them, but either way, something doesn't add up here. Samsung sold over 38 million Galaxy Note devices >> SamMobile Samsung's CEO JK Shin confirmed the sales of its Galaxy Note range that was introduced couple of years back. At a press meet during IFA, JK Shin said that the Galaxy Note range \u2013 which includes the original Galaxy Note and the Galaxy Note II \u2013 sold over 38m units. That's impressive number for a form factor that was ridiculed by many for its size initially. Shin also confirmed that regarding the Galaxy Note 3 sales, he expects \"10m units will be sold\", which we assume is the launch numbers considering the mass availability of the device from 25 September. JK Shin also supported the high price of Galaxy Gear, saying \"it provides a lot of functions.\" Galaxy Note 3 and Galaxy Gear will go on sale in 149 countries from 25 September whereas America and Japan will get it in October. \"Provides a lot of functions\" is not synonymous with \"offers a lot of functionality\". The end of email as we know it >> Buzzfeed After over 10 years of using email through clients \u2014 from Outlook to Mail to Sparrow to Mailbox \u2014 I stopped. It was about two months ago. I switched, or began switching, from Sparrow to the Gmail site. On my phone, I deactivated iPhone Mail and switched to Gmail's official app. Now Google doesn't just host and operate my email service, it owns and controls my entire email experience. I'm uneasy about this, but it was my choice. I made it, and I expect millions more will too. That's because, starting with the introduction of a fast, app-like webmail service and followed by the release of native, Gmail-specific mobile apps, Google has been recreating \u2014 and taking control of \u2014 what had become the last piece of digital real estate users could legitimately feel like they controlled: their inboxes. Gmail's new tabbed inbox was what finally pulled me over: It accomplishes, using Gmail's enormous data resources, what few, if any, personally designed email filter systems can.

If you are a whistleblower like Edward Snowden, who tells the press about illegal, immoral or embarrassing government actions, you will face jail time. But it\u2019s often another story for US government officials leaking information for their own political benefit. Two stories this week perfectly illustrate this hypocrisy and how, despite their unprecedented crackdown on sources and whistleblowers, the Obama administration - like every administration before it - loves to use leaks, if and when it suits them. Consider a government leak that ran in the New York Times on Monday. The article was about 300 of Hillary Clinton\u2019s now notorious State Department emails, which had been hidden away on her private server for years and were turned over to Congress as part of the never-ending Benghazi investigation. \u201cFour senior government officials\u201d described the content of her emails to New York Times journalists in minute detail \u201con the condition of anonymity because they did not want to jeopardize their access to secret information\u201d. Surely the Obama administration will promptly root out and prosecute those leakers, right? After all, the emails haven\u2019t gone through a security review and the chances of them discussing classified information are extremely high. (Even if they don\u2019t, the Espionage Act doesn\u2019t require the information to be classified anyways, only that information leaked be \u201crelated to national defense\u201d.) But those emails supposedly clear Clinton of any wrongdoing in the Benghazi affair, which likely makes the leak in the administration\u2019s interest. But that disclosure was nothing compared to what appeared in the Wall Street Journal a day later, in the wake of Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s underhanded attempts to derail a nuclear deal with Iran. The Journal reported on Tuesday that not only did Israel spy on Americans negotiating with Iran, but they gave that information to Republicans in Congress, in an attempt to scuttle the deal.\nHow does the US know this? Well, according to the Journal and its government sources, the US itself intercepted communications between Israeli officials that discussed information that could have only come from the US-Iran talks. The disclosure of this fact sounds exactly like the vaunted \u201csources and methods\u201d - i.e. how the US conducts surveillance and gets intelligence - that the government continually claims is the most sensitive information they have. It\u2019s why they claim Edward Snowden belongs in jail for decades. So while it\u2019s apparently unacceptable to leak details about surveillance that affects ordinary citizens\u2019 privacy, its OK for officials to do so for their own political benefit - and no one raises an eyebrow. We can be quite certain that no one will be prosecuted for the leaks given that they benefitted the administration\u2019s powerful former Secretary of State, and bolsters its position in its public dust-up with Israel. When it comes to leaks, the powerful play by different rules than everyone else - despite the fact that they\u2019ve violated the same law they\u2019ve accused so many other leakers of breaking. That\u2019s why David Petraeus was given a sweetheart plea deal with no jail time after leaking highly classified information to his biographer and lover. (He\u2019s apparently already back advising the White House, despite leaking and then lying to the FBI about the identities of countless covert officers). It\u2019s also the same reason why investigations into a leak suspected to have involved General Cartwright, once known as \u201cObama\u2019s favorite general\u201d, have stalled. As the Washington Post reported: the defense \u201cmight try to put the White House\u2019s relationship with reporters and the use of authorized leaks on display, creating a potentially embarrassing distraction for the administration\u201d. Former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling faces sentencing next month after being found guilty of leaking information to New York Times reporter James Risen. Sterling\u2019s problem is that he leaked information showing a spectacular and embarrassing failure on the CIA\u2019s part - which did not help a powerful politician score points. He is also not a general. As a result, he faces decades in jail.\n", "title": "It's OK to leak government secrets - as long as it benefits politicians | Trevor Timm"}, {"date": "2013-12-20T22:22:06Z", "body": "Barack Obama has declined to be drawn into a debate about possible amnesty for Edward Snowden, the whistleblower whose revelations about the NSA have sparked intense internal deliberation about changing US surveillance activities. In a press conference at the White House, the president distinguished between Snowden\u2019s leaks and the debate those leaks prompted, which he said was \u201can important conversation we needed to have\u201d, but left open the question of whether he should still be prosecuted. \u201cThe way in which these disclosures happened has been damaging to the United States and damaging to our intelligence capabilities,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that there was a way for us to have this conversation without that damage.

Obama said he could not comment specifically because Snowden was \u201cunder indictment,\u201d something not previously disclosed. While the Justice Department filed a criminal complaint against Snowden on espionage-related charges in June, there has been no public subsequent indictment, although it is possible one exists under gag order. The Justice Department referred comment on a Snowden indictment to the White House, which did not immediately reply. Ben Wizner, Snowden's attorney, rejected the president's contention that the debate about the NSA's activities could have taken place without Snowden.\u00a0\"The president said that we could have had this important debate without Snowden, but no one seriously believes we would have,\" Wizner told the Guardian. \"And now that a federal court and the president\u2019s own review panel have agreed that the NSA\u2019s activities are illegal and unwise, we should be thanking Snowden, not prosecuting him.\u201d\n", "title": "Obama: Snowden leaks caused 'unnecessary damage'"}, {"date": "2013-06-22T18:44:00Z", "body": "Twelve years ago, in an almost forgotten report, the European parliament completed its investigations into a long-suspected western intelligence partnership dedicated to global signals interception on a vast scale. Evidence had been taken from spies and politicians, telecommunications experts and journalists. In stark terms the report detailed a decades-old arrangement which had seen the US and the UK at first \u2013 later joined by Canada, New Zealand and Australia to make up the the so-called \"Five Eyes\" \u2013 collaborating to access satellites, transatlantic fibre-optic cables and radio signals on a vast scale. This secretive (and consistently denied) co-operation was itself the product of a mutual agreement stretching back to the first world war, expanded in the second, and finally ratified in 1948 in the so-called UKUSA agreement. The problem for the authors of the Brussels report was that it had based its analysis on scattered clues and inferences. \"It is only natural,\" its authors asserted ruefully, \"that secret services do not disclose details of their work \u2026 The existence of such a system thus needs to be proved by gathering as many clues as possible, thereby building up a convincing body of evidence.\" Despite the limitations of such detective work, the parliamentarians came to a deeply troubling conclusion: the \"Five Eyes\" were accessing the fibre-optic cables running under the Atlantic. Not only that, the report concluded tentatively, but it was the UK specifically among the five partners \u2013 and GCHQ in particular \u2013 which it suspected had been given primary responsibility for intercepting that traffic. \"The practical implication,\" the report surmised, \"is that communications can be intercepted at acceptable cost only at the terminals of the underwater cables which land on their territory. \"Essentially they can only tap incoming or outgoing cable communications. In other words, their access to cable communications in Europe is restricted to the territory of the United Kingdom.\" That GCHQ was at the very heart of secret efforts to tap into the internet and cable-carried telephony was finally confirmed in the most dramatic terms on Friday by the latest batch of documents to be leaked by former US National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, who is now being sought by the US government for alleged theft and breaches of the Espionage Act. Those documents, published by the Guardian, not only describe the UK's lead role in tapping the cables carrying global internet traffic \u2013 enjoying the \"biggest internet access\" of the Five Eyes \u2013 but its efforts to suck up ever-larger amounts of global data to share with its partners, and principally with the US. From a handful of cables at the beginning, the UK is now able, according to the documents, to access some 200 on a daily basis and store the information contained within for up to 30 days for analysis, including up to 600m \"telephone events\" each day. GCHQ's own excitement at the scope of its reach is evident in the documents, in which there is an excited reference to an ability to collect \"massive amount of data!\" and to \"producing larger amounts of metadata (the basic information on who has been contacting whom, without detailing the content) than NSA\". Up to the late 1980s, in excess of 90% of all international voice-and-data traffic, including diplomatic cables, was being carried by satellite and microwave networks. That began to change rapidly in 1988 when AT&T finished laying the first undersea fibre-optic fibre cable from New Jersey to the UK. Even before that project was completed, the NSA was already experimenting how to gain access to the cables, efforts that would lead to the US making its first attempts to bug one in the mid-1990s with an underwater vehicle. Now, the documents seem to suggest, access is achieved through some degree of co-operation \u2013 voluntary or otherwise \u2013 from the companies operating the cables or the stations at which they come into the country. And in addition to confirming details of how the partnership functions, the latest disclosures from Snowden also describe in detail what appears to be one of its latest iterations \u2013 Project Tempora, initiated some four years ago. The direct descendent of earlier UKUSA treaty programmes, Project Tempora's purpose remains the hoovering up of the largest amount of signals intelligence, principally in the form of metadata. Then, as now, it appears the priorities are not only related to national security but also economic advantage \u2013 interventions which can be justified under UK law by reference to the ill-defined notion of \"economic wellbeing\". In one sense, GCHQ is simply trying to keep up with the dizzying pace of technological development over recent decades. As the most recent batch of leaked documents has made clear \u2013 interception \u2013 like drugs-testing in sport \u2013 has tended to lag one step behind technology. \"It is becoming increasingly difficult for GCHQ,\" the authors of one memo write, \"to acquire the rich sources of traffic needed to enable our support to partners within HMG [Her Majesty's government], the armed forces, and overseas. \"The rapid development of different technologies, types of traffic, service providers and networks, and the growth in sheer volumes that accompany particularly the expansion and use of the internet, present an unprecedented challenge to the success of GCHQ's mission. Critically we are not currently able to prioritise and task the increasing range and scale of our accesses at the pace, or with the coherence demanded of the internet age: potentially available data is not accessed, potential benefit for HMG is not delivered.\" But the dangers lie in the various legal and ethical thresholds being crossed in the race to catch up with the proliferating forms of communication. If that report from almost a decade and a half ago was prescient in one area, it was over the human rights, privacy and legal concerns that were raised by the ambitions of western intelligence. Those issues have only been brought into sharper focus as signals intelligence gathering has moved ever more forcefully into capturing the worldwide web. According to the leaked Snowden documents, the latest attempts to improve interception of internet communications began in earnest in 2007. The first experimental project was run at GCHQ's outpost at Bude in Cornwall. Within two years it would be judged enough of a success to allow analysts from the NSA to have access to the new project, which by 2011 would be capturing and producing more intelligence data in the UK than the NSA did in the US. Other documents underline how the decades-old intelligence arrangement has worked, not least how within the UKUSA treaty different roles have been subcontracted to partners \u2013 for both practical and regulatory reasons. In one document, the NSA's chief Lt Gen. Keith Alexander asks pointedly: \"Why can't we collect all the signals all the time? \u2026 Sounds like a good summer project for Menwith\" \u2014 a reference to GCHQ's Menwith Hill eavesdropping site in northern England. On the legal front \u2013 as GCHQ's own lawyers boasted in advice to its US partners \u2013 Cheltenham had an advantage to its US partners: \"We have a light oversight regime compared with the US\". Such potential subcontracting has long been at the heart of international legal concerns over how surveillance material is shared between the Five Eyes. The suspicion is that individual states within the agreement can produce material for partners that might be illegal to gather in the other collaborating states, including the US. Shami Chakrabarti, the director of Liberty, said: \"The big point we should recognise is that states tend to have a broader licence to snoop abroad and a tighter one at home. What we are seeing in arrangements like this is states' ability to subcontract their dirty work to others.\" Then there is the question of oversight. The UK government claims that the interception in such a broad fashion is authorised by ministers under at least 100 certificates issued under section 8(4) of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (Ripa) which allows sweeping an indiscriminate trawls of data. But Alex Bailin QC, an expert on surveillance at the Matrix Chambers, is sceptical. \"We are told there is proper oversight but the question is whether ministers simply sign these certificates. But I wasn't even aware section 8(4) existed until Friday.\" Like Chakrabarti, Bailin suspects that intelligence agencies are subcontracting out surveillance to foreign partners. \"The reality is that Ripa is incredibly complex and full of legal loopholes that permit this kind of thing. The real question is whether the act is actually fit for purpose when you are dealing with interception like this.\" The European parliament's thesis has been confirmed by the Guardian's revelations. Now the legal and ethical scrutiny can begin in earnest.\n", "title": "NSA leaks: US and Britain team up on mass surveillance"}, {"date": "2015-05-21T11:43:50Z", "body": "In post-Snowden America, 65% of adults say that limits on the data government agencies can collect about them are not adequate, according to a new study.

The findings come two years after the Edward Snowden leaks, published in the Guardian, revealed that the US and UK security forces had access to and collected individuals\u2019 private phone call and internet data without permission, causing a backlash from the technology and security industries. Distrust of internet companies Americans show a lack of trust in internet companies, with 76% of adults saying they were \u201cnot too confident\u201d or \u201cnot at all confident\u201d that details of their internet activity would remain private or secure with advertising companies. Social media sites, search engines and video sites were equally distrusted, with 69%, 66% and 66% of adults saying they were not confident their data would remain private and secure in each respectively. Control over who could access Americans\u2019 private data and who was watching them was also a concern. According to the survey, 93% of adults said being in control of who could get information about them was important and 90% said controlling which information was collected was important. Meanwhile, 88% said it was important they weren\u2019t watched or listened in on without their permission, and half of adults thought online advertisers shouldn\u2019t be able to track their internet activities. Only 40% of those surveyed said search engines and social media sites should not track their activity, with 44% saying the same of video sites.

Editors were asked not to publish information that may \"jeopardise both national security and possibly UK personnel\" in the warning issued on 7 June, a day after the Guardian first revealed details of the National Security Agency's (NSA) secret Prism programme. The D notice, which was marked \"private and confidential: not for publication, broadcast or use on social media\", was made public on the Westminster gossip blog, Guido Fawkes. Although only advisory for editors, the self-censorship system is intended to prevent the media from making \"inadvertent public disclosure of information that would compromise UK military and intelligence operations and methods\". The warning was issued by defence officials in the UK as the BBC, ITN, Sky News and other newspapers and broadcasters around the world covered the surveillance revelations disclosed by the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. The leaks, reported extensively in the Guardian and also the Washington Post, have made headlines on both sides of the Atlantic for more than a week. However, it is not clear what impact the warning has had on media coverage of Snowden's revelations relating to British intelligence. William Hague, the foreign secretary, who is reponsible for GCHQ, was not asked when he appeared on Monday's BBC Radio 4 Today programme about reports that the spy agency was involved in monitoring communications made by foreign delegates at the G20 summit in London 2009. Instead the subject was discussed in an item aired towards the end of the programme at 8.45am. A BBC spokeswoman declined to comment on the D notice, but pointed out that the broadcaster did cover the G20 surveillance story on its radio news bulletins. She said the BBC believed it had \"afforded the story\" what the broadcaster described as \"the appropriate level of coverage\" among other significant news items, \"including the ongoing G8 summit, the sentencing of Stuart Hall, the Co-op Bank bailout and the Ian Brady hearing\". According to the Guido Fawkes website, the warning said: \"There have been a number of articles recently in connection with some of the ways in which the UK intelligence services obtain information from foreign sources. \"Although none of these recent articles has contravened any of the guidelines contained within the defence advisory notice system, the intelligence services are concerned that further developments of this same theme may begin to jeopardise both national security and possibly UK personnel.\"\n", "title": "MoD serves news outlets with D\u00a0notice over surveillance leaks"}, {"date": "2013-08-14T22:22:00Z", "body": "Bradley Manning, the soldier convicted last month of leaking an enormous collection of classified documents to WikiLeaks, has said he now regrets his actions and that he was \"sorry that they hurt the United States\". \"I am sorry for unintended consequence of my actions. When I made these decisions, I believed I was going to help people, not hurt people,\" Manning told his sentencing hearing, in an attempt to receive a reduced sentence. The 25-year-old was found guilty of several counts under the Espionage Act, but acquitted of the most serious charge of \"aiding the enemy\". He is facing a possible jail sentence of up to 90 years when he is sentenced next week. Previously, the former intelligence analyst tried to justify his actions, explaining to the court in detail how he downloaded 700,000 classified documents while stationed in Iraq and passed them to the anti-secrecy website, in order to prompt a global debate about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. However on Wednesday, after three days in which his legal team called witnesses they hoped would lead to a lower sentence, Manning took to the stand for an unsworn statement \u2013 meaning he could speak to the judge but not be cross-examined. Looking nervous, he turned to Colonel Denise Lind, who is presiding over his court martial, and said: \"First, your honour, I want to start off with an apology. I am sorry that my actions hurt people. I am sorry that I hurt the United States.\" He told the military judge that he \"was dealing with a lot of issues\" around the time he leaked the classified material, problems that he continues to effect him. \"Although a considerable difficulty in my life, these issues are not an excuse for my actions,\" he said. \"I understood what I was doing, and decisions I made. However I did not fully appreciate the broader effects of my actions. \"Those factors are clear to me now, through both self-refection during my confinement in various forms, and through the merits and sentencing testimony that I have seen here. \"I am sorry for the unintended consequences of my actions,\" he continued. \"When I made these decisions I believed I was going to help people, not hurt people.\" The soldier read out his statement in a rushed fashion, looking anxious. He told the judge that he had learned from his experience and asked for a chance to rebuild his life. The apology will disappoint Manning's thousands of supporters around the world, who believe he undertook a courageous act of whistleblowing because his conscience demanded it. Manning has achieved folk-hero status in some quarters, as the first data mass leaker of his kind, comparable to Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency who recently disclosed documents about US surveillance activities. Some of his supporters at the courthouse looked forlorn and were in tears \u2013 but pointed out he was facing almost 100 years in prison and had to do everything to seek a reduction in his punishment. In one line certain to upset those who believe Manning made a positive difference by leaking the documents, he said he now looks back at his decisions and wonders \"how on earth could I, a junior analyst, possibly believe I could change the world for the better\". Manning said that he \"had options\" other than leaking the documents, and he \"should have worked more aggressively in the system\", adding: \"Unfortunately, I can't go back and change things.\" \"I understand I must pay a price for my decisions and actions,\" he said, adding he wanted to become a better person, go to college and get a degree, and establish a \"meaningful\" relationship with his sister. \"I have flaws and issues that I have to deal with, but I know that I can and will be a better person,\" he said. \"I hope that you can give me the opportunity to prove, not through words, but through conduct, that I am a good person and that I can return to productive place in society.\" Moments earlier, Manning's sister, Casey Major, provided the court with an insight of their difficult upbringing with two alcoholic parents. Major, 36, said that while her father, Brian, was a \"functional alcoholic\", who could get up to work after drinking, her mother, Susan, had a more serious problem. She said her mother drank hard liquor from around lunchtime, and would often continue through the night until she had passed out. Asked how often she was drunk, Major replied: \"At least every day.\" Their mother would often wake-up in a terrible mood, Major said. \"She was mean, very mean, yelled, screamed at you, to get her cigarettes, or make her a cup of tea.\" She said her mother drunk through her pregnancy with Manning and, when he was born, it often fell to Major, then aged eleven, to look after her infant brother. When Manning was 12, their father left the family home. One night her mother attempted suicide, and Major recalled how when they got into the family car in their rural home in Oklahoma to drive to the hospital, their father refused to sit on the back seat to monitor their mother. \"Unfortunately my 12 year old brother had to go back there and check his mom was breathing for the whole car ride,\" she said. After that incident, she said her mother threatened to kill herself \"every day\". The court heard from another witness on Wednesday that, from childhood, Manning began to have feelings that would eventually lead to a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, which occurs when an individual feels they belong to the opposite gender. Navy Captain David Moulton, a forensic psychiatrist who spent over 100 hours interviewing Manning and reviewing his medical records, said the soldier's decision-making ability was \"impaired\" by the stress he underwent in Iraq trying to cope with his gender identity crisis. He said that Manning, who could not seek assistance for his problems in the military, was suffering from serious stress when he chose to download and then leak hundreds of thousands of documents to WikiLeaks. \"His decision-making capacity at that point I think was influenced by the stress of his situation, for sure,\" he said. The psychiatrist added that Manning's ability to \"rationally\" consider the consequences of his actions was also impeded. The soldier assumed he would merely be thrown out of the military, an assessment the psychiatrist described as a \"gross underestimation\". Manning told the psychiatrist that, if he had had a friend to talk through his moral dilemmas, \"that might have prevented these acts\". Another defence witness, Captain Michael Worsley, a clinical psychologist who evaluated and treated Manning between December 2009 and May 2010, when he was stationed in Iraq, said the pressure Manning faced \"would have been incredible\". \"I think being in the military and having a gender identity issues does not exactly go hand in hand,\" he said.\n", "title": "Bradley Manning says sorry for leaks that 'hurt the United States'"}, {"date": "2013-06-11T18:40:01Z", "body": "What have we learned in the past week? First, that analysts in America's National Security Agency are able, with legal authority, to access much of the internet traffic of those they suspect of being terrorists, narcotics traffickers, arms proliferators and no doubt other international criminals. Surprised? I think most people would have imagined that was what a modern signals intelligence agency like the NSA (and Britain's GCHQ) was for. And most reasonable people would have\u00a0welcomed the security that such intelligence can bring our nations. Second, we've learned that the NSA has allowed British intelligence \u2013 through GCHQ \u2013 to benefit from that capability. Surprised again? We have had a close relationship since the second world war, when Britain shared the achievements of Bletchley Park with the Americans. Now the US helps Britain stay safe, staying within British law. Personally I am delighted at this evidence that our transatlantic co-operation extends in this hi-tech way into the 21st century, when so much communication is carried on the internet. It would be good, nevertheless, if the UK security authorities were able to identify directly themselves more of the traffic of terrorists and serious criminals that threaten us, and I hope amended interception legislation will be\u00a0presented to parliament soon. Third, the internet companies named in the original leak have confirmed that they do not allow NSA to roam at will over their servers and read all our emails and Facebook pages. But, yes, the companies confirm they comply with American law and allow NSA access\u00a0to\u00a0required material on their suspects. Frankly, it would be scandalous if they did not. At the heart of this is a misunderstanding about what intelligence in the internet age really involves. For some the misunderstanding may well be deliberate, to advance other agendas about privacy, but I suspect for most it is because the authorities have not done enough to explain to parliament and the public how they go about balancing our rights to security and to privacy. Unlike the old days of interception by\u00a0getting the Post Office to put crocodile clips on the suspect's telephone wire, the way to access the internet communications data of suspects is by legal co-operation with the internet companies. This involves computers searching through a mass of material, of course, and that might include your and my emails and data on\u00a0our web traffic, but it is only the legally requested material that ever gets seen by a human being. These computers are not conscious beings: they will only select that which they are lawfully programmed to select. To describe this process as monitoring all our communications or \"the surveillance state\" or a \"snooper's charter\" is wholly misleading and a perverse reading of the situation. So we should not fuss too much about these specific revelations. But we should certainly not stop debating the underlying issues as technology continues to advance: about how governments go about balancing rights and responsibilities as they try both to keep us safe and to maintain a free and open society in which privacy is respected. We need therefore to be clearer about the ethical principles that should apply. I believe it would help public debate if those principles were set down and endorsed by the parliamentary intelligence services oversight committee. I would\u00a0suggest six such principles. There must be sufficient sustainable cause. Any tendency for the secret world to encroach into areas unjustified\u00a0by the scale of potential harm to national interests has to be checked. British legislation already does\u00a0this satisfactorily in terms of the limited purposes for which intelligence\u00a0can be\u00a0collected. There must be integrity of motive. No hidden agendas: the integrity of the whole system throughout the intelligence process must be assured, from collection to analysis and presentation. The methods used must be proportionate. Their likely impact must be proportionate to the harm that is sought to prevent, for example by using only the minimum intrusion necessary into the private affairs of others. There must be right and lawful authority. There must be the right level of sign-off on sensitive operations, with accountability up a recognised chain of command to permit effective oversight. There must be a reasonable prospect of success. All intelligence operations need careful risk management, and before approval is given there has to be consideration of the likelihood of unintended consequences and the impact if the operation were to be exposed or otherwise go wrong. Recourse to secret intelligence must be a last resort. There should be no reasonable alternative way of acquiring the information by non-secret methods. Self-confessed leaker Edward Snowden says the unconstrained collection of electronic intelligence is\u00a0destroying civil liberties and creating\u00a0the conditions for tyranny. Like the pacifists of the two world wars, this is an absolute and principled stand. But like those pacifists, the continued freedom of our\u00a0society ultimately rests on the refusal of the rest\u00a0of us to accept such an extreme position, and on our willingness to recognise that an ethical balancing act\u00a0is\u00a0needed. So let us respect the work of our intelligence agencies in keeping us safe,\u00a0and be glad that in our democratic societies they are subject to the rule of law. And for the future let us ensure that\u00a0they have the tools to keep up with the newest technologies. If we do not, then the only winners will be the enemies of a free and open society.\n", "title": "NSA leaks: how to make surveillance both ethical and effective | David Omand"}, {"date": "2014-11-19T01:31:13Z", "body": "It\u2019s done.

What opponents of this bill fail to appreciate is that most Americans are deeply, deeply concerned about the collection of their personal information,\u201d he says. The USA Freedom Act strikes what he calls a reasonable balance between privacy and security. Then he pulls out a much-beloved Federalist 51 quote.\nDebate starts over the USA Freedom Act for the next 30 minutes. Harry Reid says it won\u2019t take that long. Someone needs to shut their phone off.\nThe Senate hasn\u2019t yet begun debate on the USA Freedom Act, making this an opportune moment to review some of the most critical news and commentary on this contentious issue. Former NSA director and bulk-surveillance architect Michael Hayden, joined by ex-attorney general Michael Mukasey, say the bill is a gift basket to Isis. My colleague Dan Roberts and I observed in this curtain-raiser earlier today that their argument had purchase amongst powerful senators. Julian Sanchez of the Cato Institute reads that op-ed, does his best DJ Khaled, and offers criticisms of both Hayden/Mukasey and civil libertarian Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), a potential presidential hopeful who opposes the Freedom Act because he wants a more privacy-protective bill. Marcy Wheeler of Emptywheel (@emptywheel), who like Paul doesn\u2019t think the bill sufficiently safeguards privacy or meaningfully constrains the NSA, makes her case here. It\u2019s from last week, but it\u2019s obviously relevant today. For some good pre-vote reporting, check out National Journal\u2019s Dustin Volz and Brendan Sasso. And from all the way back in June, this piece of mine might serve as a reminder about the depth of opposition to the bill in the Senate intelligence committee. Finally, something that isn\u2019t totally relevant to the bill, but still: the office of the director of national intelligence declassified the transcript of Yahoo\u2019s 2008 argument before the secret surveillance appeals court. (Quite an interesting timing decision.) I post it here to make sure it doesn\u2019t get ignored in the crush of today\u2019s news.\nWelcome to our liveblog of the Senate\u2019s vote on the USA Freedom Act, a rare bill to restrict NSA surveillance that emerged after Edward Snowden\u2019s leaks. It\u2019s a do-or-die moment: either the bill clears a 60-vote threshold to move forward, or it fails, and the NSA will retain its powers to collect data from practically every American phone call. The outcome is as uncertain as the acrimony is intense. The battle behind the bill is a story of shifting alliances and political calculations. Privacy groups are united with US intelligence agencies in backing it, but for opposite reasons: the civil libertarians feel it doesn\u2019t go far enough to curb dragnet surveillance; the spies, who substantially rewrote the House counterpart, fear losing even more power if the bill fails. Its opponents, Republican and Democrat, consider it a gift to terrorists. We\u2019ll be bringing you the whole frequently updated story here.\n", "title": "Landmark bill to limit NSA surveillance dies in Senate \u2013\u00a0live updates"}, {"date": "2015-02-23T18:06:04Z", "body": "Binyamin Netanyahu\u2019s dramatic declaration to world leaders in 2012 that Iran was about a year away from making a nuclear bomb was contradicted by his own secret service, according to a top-secret Mossad document. It is part of a cache of hundreds of dossiers, files and cables from the world\u2019s major intelligence services \u2013 one of the biggest spy leaks in recent times. Brandishing a cartoon of a bomb with a red line to illustrate his point, the Israeli prime minister warned the UN in New York that Iran would be able to build nuclear weapons the following year and called for action to halt the process. But in a secret report shared with South Africa a few weeks later, Israel\u2019s intelligence agency concluded that Iran was \u201cnot performing the activity necessary to produce weapons\u201d. The report highlights the gulf between the public claims and rhetoric of top Israeli politicians and the assessments of Israel\u2019s military and intelligence establishment.\nThe disclosure comes as tensions between Israel and its staunchest ally, the US, have dramatically increased ahead of Netanyahu\u2019s planned address to the US Congress on 3 March. The White House fears the Israeli leader\u2019s anticipated inflammatory rhetoric could damage sensitive negotiations between Tehran and the world\u2019s six big powers over Iran\u2019s nuclear programme. The deadline to agree on a framework is in late March, with the final settlement to come on 30 June. Netanyahu has vowed to block an agreement he claims would give Iran access to a nuclear weapons capability. The US president, Barack Obama, will not meet Netanyahu during his visit, saying protocol precludes a meeting so close to next month\u2019s general election in Israel. The documents, almost all marked as confidential or top secret, span almost a decade of global intelligence traffic, from 2006 to December last year. It has been leaked to the al-Jazeera investigative unit and shared with the Guardian. The papers include details of operations against al-Qaida, Islamic State and other terrorist organisations, but also the targeting of environmental activists. The files reveal that: \u2022 The CIA attempted to establish contact with Hamas in spite of a US ban. \u2022 South Korean intelligence targeted the leader of Greenpeace. \u2022 Barack Obama \u201cthreatened\u201d the Palestinian president to withdraw a bid for recognition of Palestine at the UN. \u2022 South African intelligence spied on Russia over a controversial $100m joint satellite deal. The cache, which has been independently authenticated by the Guardian, mainly involves exchanges between South Africa\u2019s intelligence agency and its counterparts around the world. It is not the entire volume of traffic but a selective leak. One of the biggest hauls is from Mossad. But there are also documents from Russia\u2019s FSB, which is responsible for counter-terrorism. Such leaks of Russian material are extremely rare. Other spy agencies caught up in the trawl include those of the US, Britain, France, Jordan, the UAE, Oman and several African nations. The scale of the leak, coming 20 months after US whistleblower Edward Snowden handed over tens of thousands of NSA and GCHQ documents to the Guardian, highlights the increasing inability of intelligence agencies to keep their secrets secure. While the Snowden trove revealed the scale of technological surveillance, the latest spy cables deal with espionage at street level \u2013 known to the intelligence agencies as human intelligence, or \u201chumint\u201d. They include surveillance reports, inter-agency information trading, disinformation and backbiting, as well as evidence of infiltration, theft and blackmail. The leaks show how Africa is becoming increasingly important for global espionage, with the US and other western states building up their presence on the continent and China expanding its economic influence. One serving intelligence officer told the Guardian: \u201cSouth Africa is the El Dorado of espionage.\u201d Africa has also become caught up in the US, Israeli and British covert global campaigns to stem the spread of Iranian influence, tighten sanctions and block its nuclear programme. The Mossad briefing about Iran\u2019s nuclear programme in 2012 was in stark contrast to the alarmist tone set by Netanyahu, who has long presented the Iranian nuclear programme as an existential threat to Israel and a huge risk to world security. The Israeli prime minister told the UN: \u201cBy next spring, at most by next summer, at current enrichment rates, they will have finished the medium enrichment and move[d] on to the final stage. From there, it\u2019s only a few months, possibly a few weeks before they get enough enriched uranium for the first bomb.\u201d He said his information was not based on secret information or military intelligence but International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reports. Behind the scenes, Mossad took a different view. In a report shared with South African spies on 22 October 2012 \u2013 but likely written earlier \u2013 it conceded that Iran was \u201cworking to close gaps in areas that appear legitimate, such as enrichment reactors, which will reduce the time required to produce weapons from the time the instruction is actually given\u201d. But the report also states that Iran \u201cdoes not appear to be ready\u201d to enrich uranium to the higher levels necessary for nuclear weapons. To build a bomb requires enrichment to 90%. Mossad estimated that Iran then had \u201cabout 100kg of material enriched to 20%\u201d (which was later diluted or converted under the terms of the 2013 Geneva agreement). Iran has always said it is developing a nuclear programme for civilian energy purposes. Last week, Netanyahu\u2019s office repeated the claim that \u201cIran is closer than ever today to obtaining enriched material for a nuclear bomb\u201d in a statement in response to an IAEA report. A senior Israeli government official said there was no contradiction between Netanyahu\u2019s statements on the Iranian nuclear threat and \u201cthe quotes in your story \u2013 allegedly from Israeli intelligence\u201d. Both the prime minister and Mossad said Iran was enriching uranium in order to produce weapons, he added. \u201cIsrael believes the proposed nuclear deal with Iran is a bad deal, for it enables the world\u2019s foremost terror state to create capabilities to produce the elements necessary for a nuclear bomb,\u201d he said. However, Mossad had been at odds with Netanyahu on Iran before. The former Mossad chief Meir Dagan, who left office in December 2010, let it be known that he had opposed an order from Netanyahu to prepare a military attack on Iran. Other members of Israel\u2019s security establishment were riled by Netanyahu\u2019s rhetoric on the Iranian nuclear threat and his advocacy of military confrontation. In April 2012, a former head of Shin Bet, Israel\u2019s internal security agency, accused Netanyahu of \u201cmessianic\u201d political leadership for pressing for military action, saying he and the then defence minister, Ehud Barak, were misleading the public on the Iran issue. Benny Gantz, the Israeli military chief of staff, said decisions on tackling Iran \u201cmust be made carefully, out of historic responsibility but without hysteria\u201d. There were also suspicions in Washington that Netanyahu was seeking to bounce Obama into taking a more hawkish line on Iran. A few days before Netanyahu\u2019s speech to the UN, the then US defence secretary, Leon Panetta, accused the Israeli prime minister of trying to force the US into a corner. \u201cThe fact is \u2026 presidents of the United States, prime ministers of Israel or any other country \u2026 don\u2019t have, you know, a bunch of little red lines that determine their decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat they have are facts that are presented to them about what a country is up to, and then they weigh what kind of action is needed in order to deal with that situation. I mean, that\u2019s the real world. Red lines are kind of political arguments that are used to try to put people in a corner.\u201d\n", "title": "Leaked cables show Netanyahu\u2019s Iran bomb claim contradicted by Mossad"}, {"date": "2015-02-26T14:43:38Z", "body": "A veteran of South Africa\u2019s anti-apartheid struggle has expressed \u201csadness, hurt and deep disappointment\u201d that the country\u2019s democratic government may have been spying on him. Kumi Naidoo, now the international head of Greenpeace, said he had gained legal representation and wanted an urgent meeting with the minister responsible for intelligence after leaked cables revealed that he was targeted as a potential security threat ahead of a major global summit.\nThe human rights campaigner questioned why South Africa, one of the world\u2019s most unequal societies, would waste money on spies to monitor his activities when it could find the information for free on his Facebook or Twitter accounts or the Greenpeace website. Naidoo, who grew up in poverty during white minority rule, became an activist when he was 15. He was arrested several times, put on trial and, facing a possible 15-year jail term, fled into exile in Britain. His contribution has been recognised by a national photography and film project called 21 Icons that also includes Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu. In 2009 he became the first African to lead Greenpeace, one of the world\u2019s best known environmental groups. South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service asked South Africa for a \u201cspecific security assessment\u201d of Naidoo ahead of a meeting of G20 leaders in Seoul in 2010. The request linked him with two other South Africans who had been swept up in an anti-terrorist raid in Pakistan but later released and returned to South Africa. It is not clear whether South African intelligence complied with the request. The details emerged this week from hundreds of dossiers, files and cables obtained by al-Jazeera and shared with the Guardian in what has been described as the worst security breach in South Africa\u2019s post-apartheid history. \u201cMy main reaction when I was contacted by al-Jazeera was not one of surprise or frustration or anger,\u201d Naidoo said on Thursday. \u201cIt was one of sadness, hurt and deep disappointment. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if it\u2019s a shock, I\u2019ll be honest. After the Edward Snowden and WikiLeaks revelations, you\u2019d have to be rather naive to say: \u2018Oh, I was shocked.\u2019 We make assumptions that it\u2019s happening, but to have it confirmed has a chilling and numbing effect. What\u2019s important to note is that this can send a very negative message about democratic participation in society.\u201d The 50-year-old has visited South Korea several times and believes its intelligence service made the request because of his outspoken opposition to nuclear power. \u201cIn 2010 when the G20 meeting was taking place in South Korea, one of the things that the South Korean government had on its agenda was to use that opportunity to push its nuclear technology, particularly in the direction of countries like South Africa, Turkey and India.\n\u201cBut what hurts more is an impression that I now have that my government might have \u2013 I\u2019m going to be generous and say \u2018might have\u2019 \u2013 been engaged in surveillance activity against me, as well as might have shared that with South Korean intelligence upon request.\u201d Some cables published this week show South Africa receiving requests only to deny them, Naidoo added, citing the example of Cameroon asking for information on the country\u2019s opposition leader, Pierre Mila Assout\u00e9. But he noted: \u201cWhat I don\u2019t see in the cables that are available is in fact a denial from the South African government to the South Koreans, saying: \u2018This is a citizen of ours who was part of the liberation struggle who had been supporting democracy and human rights since the age of 15 and we do not believe there\u2019s any reason for you to [make this request] \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t even have to tell them any of what I\u2019ve just said. They should have just done what they did for the Cameroonian opposition party and said there\u2019s no way, and I\u2019m hoping that\u2019s the case, but right now from the way it reads, it doesn\u2019t seem to be the case.\u201d Naidoo, a former Rhodes scholar at Oxford University, said he would now seek official answers with representation from the Legal Resources Centre, an organisation renowned for its work during the struggle and more recent crises such as the Marikana mine massacre.Its senior counsel, George Bizos, was Nelson Mandela\u2019s lawyer and close friend for half a century. Naidoo has also written to the state security minister, David Mahlobo, to request a meeting as soon as possible. \u201cEssentially what I would like to hear from my government is that one, we did not collaborate with the South Korean intelligence and share that information, and secondly I would like to have a confirmation that I\u2019m not a subject of surveillance and monitoring.\u201d He continued: \u201cIt\u2019s important that we recognise that in a country where so many of our people do not have access to proper housing, proper electricity, proper sanitation \u2013 and let me just say, saying \u2018proper sanitation\u2019 is a bit of jargon for a decent place to shit and piss, and that\u2019s a basic human right that many of our people don\u2019t have \u2013 I see resources being wasted on surveillance and other activities, most of which information is easily available on Twitter, Facebook and the Greenpeace website.\n\u201cI\u2019m very transparent about all the places, what I\u2019m doing, the activities and so on: it\u2019s a much cheaper way to actually collect any information rather than having people\u2019s privacy being invaded.\u201d Naidoo, the international executive director of Greenpeace, also plans to write an open letter to the South African president, Jacob Zuma, outlining his concerns and how they relate to the broader energy crisis facing South Africa, which plans to invest heavily in nuclear power stations. \u201cPut simply, nuclear is too expensive, too dangerous and as a so-called solution to our electricity crisis and as solution to climate change, will deliver too little too late.\u201d Concluding a press conference at Johannesburg\u2019s Constitution Hill, which once held political prisoners including Gandhi and Mandela but is now home to the country\u2019s highest court, he admitted: \u201cIt has been quite emotionally challenging for me. To be honest I was completely comfortable to be monitored and surveilled by the apartheid state. \u201cIn fact in those days if they weren\u2019t surveilling you at all it was like a little bit of a bad thing. It was like, \u2018What? They didn\u2019t come and arrest you, they\u2019re not monitoring you? Oh comrade, you\u2019re not so militant!\u2019 \u201cSo I have no problem with that during that period, but I do feel deeply hurt if resources are being used [for it now]. I want to believe that I will get the confirmation from my government saying that it\u2019s not been the case and they did not share information on me with any external, whether it\u2019s South Korean or other agencies.\u201d Under growing pressure, the South African government issued a response to the leaks on Wednesday, saying a full investigation had been launched. \u201cThe leaking of the purported documents detailing operational details of the State Security Agency is condemned in the strongest possible terms,\u201d Mahlobo said. \u201cIt is illegal to disclose such information outside of the classification protocols in place. Such conduct has the dangerous effect of undermining operational effectiveness of the work to secure this country and borders on undermining diplomatic relations with our partners in the international community. Any leakages of classified information undermine the national security of any state.\u201d\n", "title": "Greenpeace head Kumi Naidoo saddened at spying revelations"}, {"date": "2013-10-25T17:45:00Z", "body": "The UK intelligence agency GCHQ has repeatedly warned it fears a \"damaging public debate\" on the scale of its activities because it could lead to legal challenges against its mass-surveillance programmes, classified internal documents reveal. Memos contained in the cache disclosed by the US whistleblower Edward Snowden detail the agency's long fight against making intercept evidence admissible as evidence in criminal trials \u2013 a policy supported by all three major political parties, but ultimately defeated by the UK's intelligence community. Foremost among the reasons was a desire to minimise the potential for challenges against the agency's large-scale interception programmes, rather than any intrinsic threat to security, the documents show. The papers also reveal that: \u2022 GCHQ lobbied furiously to keep secret the fact that telecoms firms had gone \"well beyond\" what they were legally required to do to help intelligence agencies' mass interception of communications, both in the UK and overseas. \u2022 GCHQ feared a legal challenge under the right to privacy in the Human Rights Act if evidence of its surveillance methods became admissible in court. \u2022 GCHQ assisted the Home Office in lining up sympathetic people to help with \"press handling\", including the Liberal Democrat peer and former intelligence services commissioner Lord Carlile, who this week criticised the Guardian for its coverage of mass surveillance by GCHQ and America's National Security Agency. The most recent attempt to make intelligence gathered from intercepts admissible in court, proposed by the last Labour government, was finally stymied by GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 in 2009. A briefing memo prepared for the board of GCHQ shortly before the decision was made public revealed that one reason the agency was keen to quash the proposals was the fear that even passing references to its wide-reaching surveillance powers could start a \"damaging\" public debate. Referring to the decision to publish the report on intercept as evidence without classification, it noted: \"Our main concern is that references to agency practices (ie the scale of interception and deletion) could lead to damaging public debate which might lead to legal challenges against the current regime.\" A later update, from May 2012, set out further perceived \"risks\" of making intercepts admissible, including \"the damage to partner relationships if sensitive information were accidentally released in open court\". It also noted that the \"scale of interception and retention required would be fairly likely to be challenged on Article 8 (Right to Privacy) grounds\". The GCHQ briefings showed the agency provided the Home Office with support in winning the PR battle on the proposed reforms by lining up people to talk to the media \u2013 including Lord Carlile, who on Wednesday gave a public lecture condemning the Guardian's decision to publish stories based on the leaked material from Snowden. Referring to the public debate on intercept evidence, the document notes: \"Sir Ken McDonald [sic] (former DPP [director of public prosecutions]), Lord Goldsmith (former AG [attorney general]) and David Davis (former Shadow HSec [home secretary) [have been] reiterating their previous calls for IaE [intercept as evidence]. \"We are working closely with HO [Home Office] on their plans for press handling when the final report is published, e.g. lining up talking heads (such as Lord Carlisle [sic], Lord Stevens, Sir Stephen Lander, Sir Swinton Thomas).\" Carlile was the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation in 2001-11, and was awarded a CBE in 2012 for his services to national security. Another top GCHQ priority in resisting the admission of intercepts as evidence was keeping secret the extent of the agency's co-operative relationships with telephone companies \u2013 including being granted access to communications networks overseas. In June, the Guardian disclosed the existence of GCHQ's Tempora internet surveillance programme. It uses intercepts on the fibre-optic cables that make up the backbone of the internet to gain access to vast swaths of internet users' personal data. The intercepts are placed in the UK and overseas, with the knowledge of companies owning either the cables or landing stations. The revelations of voluntary co-operation with some telecoms companies appear to contrast markedly with statements made by large telecoms firms in the wake of the first Tempora stories. They stressed that they were simply complying with the law of the countries in which they operated. In reality, numerous telecoms companies were doing much more than that, as disclosed in a secret document prepared in 2009 by a joint working group of GCHQ, MI5 and MI6. Their report contended that allowing intercepts as evidence could damage relationships with \"Communications Service Providers\" (CSPs). In an extended excerpt of \"the classified version\" of a review prepared for the Privy Council, a formal body of advisers made up of current and former cabinet ministers, the document sets out the real nature of the relationship between telecoms firms and the UK government. \"Under RIPA [the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000], CSPs in the UK may be required to provide, at public expense, an adequate interception capability on their networks,\" it states. \"In practice all significant providers do provide such a capability. But in many cases their assistance \u2013 while in conformity with the law \u2013 goes well beyond what it requires.\" GCHQ's internet surveillance programme is the subject of a challenge in the European court of human rights, mounted by three privacy advocacy groups. The Open Rights Group, English PEN and Big Brother Watch argue the \"unchecked surveillance\" of Tempora is a challenge to the right to privacy, as set out in the European convention on human rights. That the Tempora programme appears to rely at least in part on voluntary co-operation of telecoms firms could become a major factor in that ongoing case. The revelation could also reignite the long-running debate over allowing intercept evidence in court. GCHQ's submission goes on to set out why its relationships with telecoms companies go further than what can be legally compelled under current law. It says that in the internet era, companies wishing to avoid being legally mandated to assist UK intelligence agencies would often be able to do so \"at little cost or risk to their operations\" by moving \"some or all\" of their communications services overseas. As a result, \"it has been necessary to enter into agreements with both UK-based and offshore providers for them to afford the UK agencies access, with appropriate legal authorisation, to the communications they carry outside the UK\". The submission to ministers does not set out which overseas firms have entered into voluntary relationships with the UK, or even in which countries they operate, though documents detailing the Tempora programme made it clear the UK's interception capabilities relied on taps located both on UK soil and overseas. There is no indication as to whether the governments of the countries in which deals with companies have been struck would be aware of the GCHQ cable taps. Evidence that telecoms firms and GCHQ are engaging in mass interception overseas could stoke an ongoing diplomatic row over surveillance ignited this week after the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, accused the NSA of monitoring her phone calls, and the subsequent revelation that the agency monitored communications of at least 35 other world leaders. On Friday, Merkel and the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, agreed to spearhead efforts to make the NSA sign a new code of conduct on how it carried out intelligence operations within the European Union, after EU leaders warned that the international fight against terrorism was being jeopardised by the perception that mass US surveillance was out of control. Fear of diplomatic repercussions were one of the prime reasons given for GCHQ's insistence that its relationships with telecoms firms must be kept private . Telecoms companies \"feared damage to their brands internationally, if the extent of their co-operation with HMG [Her Majesty's government] became apparent\", the GCHQ document warned. It added that if intercepts became admissible as evidence in UK courts \"many CSPs asserted that they would withdraw their voluntary support\". The report stressed that while companies are going beyond what they are required to do under UK law, they are not being asked to violate it. Shami Chakrabarti, Director of Liberty and Anthony Romero Executive Director of the American Civil Liberties Union issued a joint statement stating: \"The Guardian's publication of information from Edward Snowden has uncovered a breach of trust by the US and UK Governments on the grandest scale. The newspaper's principled and selective revelations demonstrate our rulers' contempt for personal rights, freedoms and the rule of law. \"Across the globe, these disclosures continue to raise fundamental questions about the lack of effective legal protection against the interception of all our communications. \"Yet in Britain, that conversation is in danger of being lost beneath self-serving spin and scaremongering, with journalists who dare to question the secret state accused of aiding the enemy. \"A balance must of course be struck between security and transparency, but that cannot be achieved whilst the intelligence services and their political masters seek to avoid any scrutiny of, or debate about, their actions. \"The Guardian's decision to expose the extent to which our privacy is being violated should be applauded and not condemned.\"\n", "title": "Leaked memos reveal GCHQ efforts to keep mass surveillance secret"}, {"date": "2014-10-23T02:34:07Z", "body": "Freedom is difficult to resuscitate once extinguished. Australian attorney-general George Brandis recently chastised journalists for criticising his government\u2019s new laws aimed at preventing reporting about \u201cspecial intelligence operations\u201d. Because he\u2019s a culture warrior brawler, Brandis damned the \u201cusual suspects of the paranoid, fantasist left\u201d but also \u201creputable conservative commentators\u201d for questioning his judgment over what citizens should and should not learn through the media. It\u2019s a tragic irony that the loudest voices backing the current war on whistle-blowers are the very politicians who are theoretically elected to protect and enhance free speech and disclosure. \u201cNever believe anything until it\u2019s officially denied\u201d was a favourite expression of the Irish journalist Claud Cockburn, father of the British reporter Patrick Cockburn. It\u2019s a motto worth remembering as we\u2019re faced with a barrage of state-led and private interest attacks on leaks and leakers. The examples are many, but what occurred on Thursday raises grave concerns for whistleblowers in Australia. Take the case of Freya Newman, a young and part-time librarian at Whitehouse School of Design in Sydney. She accessed information on the institute\u2019s computer system that showed prime minister Tony Abbott\u2019s daughter, Frances Abbott, received a \u201cchairman\u2019s scholarship\u201d worth $60,000. Newman has pleaded guilty to the offence of unauthorised access to a computer system, and on Thursday appeared in court. The prosecution appeared not to be pushing for a jail sentence but a record of the crime. The fact remains that Newman has been aggressively pursued for a noble example of exposing a matter of public interest. Newman\u2019s whistleblowing was defended by lawyer Julian Burnside as vital insights into secret access and clearly should be designated as in the public interest. Crucially, he notes that she would have been likely protected by whistleblower protection if working for a government organisation but she was exposed to legal censure because she was employed by a private organisation. Independent news website New Matilda has released a slew of leaks this year and faced heavy, but predictable criticism. New Matilda operates differently, aiming to piss off the pompously positioned. The current controversy over Sydney University\u2019s Barry Spurr, a consultant to the Abbott government\u2019s review of the national curriculum, is yet another case of smearing a whistle-blower who released a slew of racist and sexist emails to New Matilda. In an outrageous attack on press freedom, Spurr has tried to legally force New Matilda to reveal its sources and prevent them publishing anything else related to the story. It\u2019s a case of attempted intimidation that New Matilda has happily challenged, and later on Thursday Spurr dropped his bid to expose the source, although the case is still continuing. I\u2019m yet to read other media outlets offering support for the small publisher. Rather than address the issues raised by Spurr\u2019s compromised position as a man who longs for colonial times, The Australian\u2019s Sharri Markson reported that the emails may have been obtained by hacking, allegations slammed by editor Chris Graham. The source of the leak is again questioned in an Australian editorial: \u201cthe [New Matilda] website maintains [the story] is based on leaks from a source, rather than hacking, as Professor Spurr alleges\u201d. Even entertainer Barry Humphries has damned the release of the emails, wilfully ignoring the political significance of such a man with vile views to perpetuate white Australia in the education system of the 21st century. There are many other examples of this war on whistleblowers in Australia. Immigration minister Scott Morrison has maintained a medieval seal on details over his border security policy and yet has been happy to find friendly, News Corp Australia reporters to smear critics of his policy. The government has now referred Save the Children workers to be investigated by the Australian Federal Police over \u201cunauthorised\u201d disclosures of information. It was clear intimidation, designed to make employees shut up. In a haze of claims and counter-claims, with Operation Sovereign Borders celebrated as saving taxpayer dollars, the detail of a breach of security within the department is ignored or dismissed as insignificant. The source of these allegations against Save the Children was first reported in a Daily Telegraph story as being from an intelligence report that they also appear to have been leaked, and which was published on the day of Morrison\u2019s announcement about the investigation. Leaking to obedient journalists doesn\u2019t indicate a healthy whistle-blower culture but rather a docile political environment that rewards favouritism. It reduces democracy to sanctioned drops into reporter\u2019s in-boxes. Amidst all the fury over angry ideologues concerned that their bigoted conservative values are under attack lie the importance of whistle-blowing without fear or favour. It\u2019s a global problem that\u2019s being led by Nobel Peace Prize winner himself, US president Barack Obama. His administration is publicly supportive of disclosure while prosecuting countless people including the New York Times\u2019 James Risen and perfecting the selective leak to cosy reporters. It\u2019s a particular problem with national security journalism, where the vast bulk of writing is left to stenographers of the bloated intelligence and military apparatus. Effective whistleblower legislation in democracies isn\u2019t enough because governments have proven their willingness to protect anything that embarrasses or shames them. The persecution of Julian Assange, Edward Snowden, Chelsea Manning and Thomas Drake, amongst others, is about saving face and not lives. Journalists, aggressive media companies and citizens must revolt and challenge the very fundamentals of our secretive age. This means publishing state and business secrets and widening the overly narrow definition of what constitutes being in the public interest. Rejecting the criminalising of journalism should be in every reporter\u2019s DNA. The Snowden releases have fundamentally altered the ways in which we understand digital journalism and how we must protect sources away from prying private and government eyes. Over a year ago I wrote an article outlining the range of documents and stories that need to be told by the invaluable work of whistle-blowers. Today I\u2019m calling for all documents that reveal the operational details of Operation Sovereign Borders, the legal justification for providing Iraqi immunity for Australian special forces in Iraq and the evidence of Australian acquiescence in abandoning citizen Julian Assange at London\u2019s Ecuadorian embassy.\n", "title": "Australia's war on whistleblowers must end"}, {"date": "2014-03-10T22:01:00Z", "body": "", "title": "Edward Snowden talks NSA and internet surveillance at SXSW - video"}, {"date": "2014-06-18T00:35:43Z", "body": "Hillary Clinton has thrown her weight behind political efforts to rein in US surveillance powers in her most forthright criticism yet of the National Security Agency (NSA). The former secretary of state, who has hitherto largely stayed out of the debate sparked by leaks from NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, called on Congress to restore constitutional privacy protections weakened after terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centre. \"We are finally taking stock of the laws that we passed after 9/11,\" she told Fox News interviewer Greta Van Susteren. \"We did all of this in an a hurry because we were worried and scared and now we need to take a step back and figure out how we make sure that the balance between liberty and security is right.\" Clinton, who admitted in an earlier CNN interview that she had disagreed with her husband's cautious support for Snowden, defended the government's legal right to carry out some bulk collection of American data but said she now backed efforts in Congress to change the law. \"Laws that were passed after 9/11 gave the executive very broad authority ... what has happened is that people have said, OK, the emergency is over and we want to get back to regular order,\" she said. \"It's a really difficult balancing act, but you are absolutely right that we need to make some changes to secure that constitutional right to privacy that Americans are due.\" The House of Representatives recently passed a version of the USA Freedom Act that seeks to outlaw the bulk collection of American data, although civil liberties campaigners worry that it has been watered down by administration lawyers and are pushing for a tougher version in the Senate. Clinton was also scathing the of NSA's spying on the leaders of foreign allies such as Germany and was asked whether chancellor Angela Merkel was right to be angry. \"Yes, she should be. That was absolutely uncalled for,\" replied Clinton. \"There is [legitimate counter-terrorism] work that we need to do with the Germans and inside Germany ... that has nothing to do with Angela Merkel's cell phone and that should be off limits.\" The Fox News interview, a rare foray by Clinton in hostile political territory, was dominated by familiar questions about her reaction to attacks on US consular staff in Benghazi but the former secretary of state also strayed into more contemporary diplomatic questions during a separate interview on CNN. Clinton appeared to distance herself from suggestions by current secretary of state John Kerry that the US could seek assistance from Iran in stemming insurgent attacks in Iraq. \"I am not prepared to say that we go in with Iran right now until we have a better idea what we are getting ourselves into,\" she told CNN. But Clinton also supported a growing consensus inside Democratic circles that unilateral US military intervention could also be a mistake. She criticised Iraqi prime minister Maliki, claiming he had \"purged the military that we trained ... and forced out some of the most able commanders\" and suggested the White House was seeking tougher assurances from him before offering support. \"I think that right now there are those hard negotiations going on,\" said Clinton. \"With respect to air attacks that needs to be part of a larger package and I believe that is part of the intense negotiations that are going on.\" She also said it was a mistake for Iraq not to strike an agreement for an ongoing US troop presence after its main military withdrawal.\n", "title": "Hillary Clinton backs overhaul of surveillance powers in NSA criticism"}, {"date": "2014-10-01T03:16:44Z", "body": "The Guardian US has won an Emmy for its groundbreaking coverage of Edward Snowden\u2019s disclosures about mass surveillance by US intelligence agencies.

The report said the authorities were never told that one of the killers, Michael Adebowale, wrote of his murderous intent six months before he and his accomplice, Michael Adebolajo, brutally attacked Rigby in May 2013 in a street near his military barracks and attempted to behead him. Facebook had not spotted Adebowale\u2019s message containing \u201cgraphic\u201d threats, so the security services were not told. The report by the parliamentary intelligence and security committee (ISC) said if the message had been passed to MI5 it could have prevented the murder of the soldier. The ISC chair, Sir Malcolm Rifkind, accused internet companies of providing a \u201csafe haven\u201d to terrorists but said a despite a string of failings by the security services, which had repeatedly monitored both men before the attack, there was nothing they could have done to prevent the murder of Rigby. The report said that if the authorities had been given the message, \u201cthere is then a significant possibility that MI5 would have been able to prevent the attack\u201d. The findings put internet companies and privacy firmly in the sights of lawmakers and the prime minister. David Cameron vowed to take action but an internet rights group warned against co-opting companies and turning them into an arm of the surveillance state. The ISC report also said the British government may have been complicit in ill-treatment suffered by Adebolajo during his detention in Kenya in 2010, where he complained of being beaten, and threatened with electrocution and rape after being arrested with other alleged extremists. It also criticised evidence from former MI6 chief Sir John Sawers, saying it was wrong and a document showing this had initially not been given to the committee by the intelligence service. The government announce a new package of counter-terrorism measures on Wednesday , triggering a new round in the debate over the balance between security and privacy that has raged since the attack on the World Trade Center in 2001. Rifkind said of Facebook: \u201cThis company does not regard themselves as under any obligation to ensure that they identify such threats, or to report them to the authorities. We find this unacceptable: however unintentionally, they are providing a safe haven for terrorists.\u201d In the Commons, Cameron ratcheted up the pressure: \u201cTheir networks are being used to plot murder and mayhem. It is their social responsibility to act on this and we expect them to live up to that responsibility.\u201d The ISC said in its report: \u201cWhilst we note that progress has started to be made on this issue, with the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014 (Drip) and the appointment of the special envoy on intelligence and law-enforcement data-sharing, the problem is acute. The prime minister, with the National Security Council, should prioritise this issue.\u201d Facebook had closed down some accounts by Adebowale and in a statement made after being named as the company in the report, said: \u201cLike everyone else, we were horrified by the vicious murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby. We don\u2019t comment on individual cases but Facebook\u2019s policies are clear, we do not allow terrorist content on the site and take steps to prevent people from using our service for these purposes.\u201d It had an automated program to stop message content deemed unacceptable \u2013 but the message discussing murdering a soldier was not picked up until after the killing. Isabella Sankey, director of policy for the civil rights group Liberty, said: \u201cThe ISC shamefully spins the facts seeking to blame the communications companies for not doing the agencies\u2019 work for them.\u201d Jim Killock, of Open Rights, which campaigns on issues such as online surveillance, censorship and privacy, said: \u201cTo pass the blame to internet companies is to use Fusilier Rigby\u2019s murder to make cheap political points. It is quite extraordinary to demand that companies proactively monitor email content for suspicious material.\u201d The report said even if the security servicesfailings it identified had not occurred, their knowledge of the two extremists would not have led analysts to assess them as poised to strike. Adebolajo, the more dominant of the two , had featured in five MI5 investigations and Adebowale in two, but none found evidence of an attack. The ISC said MI5 made errors and was plagued by delays, but even if corrected none of this would have helped the security service to spot the level of danger posed by the attackers before they struck. The committee said that at any time MI5 investigated several thousand individuals linked to militant Islamist activities in the UK. The inquiry was set up to investigate the role of the intelligence agencies, which had the two men under surveillance. \u201cThere were errors in these operations, where processes were not followed, decisions not recorded, or delays encountered. However, we do not consider that any of these errors, taken individually, were significant enough to have made a difference,\u201d the report says. \u201cAdebolajo was a high priority for MI5 during two operations: they put significant effort into investigating him and employed a broad range of intrusive techniques. None of these revealed any evidence of attack planning,\u201d the committee says. \u201cBy contrast, Michael Adebowale was never more than a low level SoI [subject of interest] and the agencies took appropriate action based on the rigorous threshold set down in law: they had not received any intelligence that Adebowale was planning an attack and, based on that evidence, more intrusive action would not have been justified.\u201d Rigby was returning to barracks in Woolwich, south London, on 22 May 2013 from an army recruiting office at the Tower of London when he was run over by a car driven by Adebolajo. The two killers then attacked the soldier with knives. Ray Dutton, Rigby\u2019s uncle, said the report confirmed his belief that his nephew\u2019s murder could not have been prevented. \u201cMistakes have been made possibly, perhaps we could have done a little bit more,\u201d he told BBC News. \u201cBut in my heart of hearts I can\u2019t believe that \u2013 even with further evidence \u2013 Lee\u2019s murder could have been stopped. Everyone in Britain at that time was in this cocoon of safety on our streets. That was smashed by these two murderers for their religious gain.\u201d The report also concluded that: Given that there are 500 or more Britons fighting in Syria and Iraq, years of counter-terrorism policies in the UK had failed: \u201cThe scale of the problem indicates that the government\u2019s counter-terrorism programmes are not working.\u201d The ISC refused to confirm or deny claims that MI5 had tried to recruit Adebolajo in Kenya as an informant. He was detained in Kenya in 2010 trying to join Islamist militants in neighbouring Somalia, and eventually came back to Britain. The ISC said: \u201cTo publish information in response to allegations that MI5 harassed Adebolajo or tried to recruit him as an agent would damage national security \u2013 irrespective of the substance of such allegations.\u201d MI6 \u2013 formally known as the Secret Intelligence Service \u2013 was strongly criticised for the way it dealt with the allegation that Adebolajo was ill treated in Kenya: \u201cThe committee is concerned by SIS\u2019s approach on this occasion to allegations of mistreatment, which appears dismissive. Prejudging allegations in this way is completely inappropriate.\u201d Parts of the report are redacted but the prime minister received the full version. The Guardian understands senior figures in MI6 expressed anger at the criticisms in the report. One source familiar with the committee\u2019s work said: \u201cIt is fair to say that the chaps across the river are not happy at all.\u201d The report\u2019s final recommendation is redacted and reads: \u201cAdebolajo\u2019s allegations of mistreatment potentially related to a ***. It is essential that ministers are informed immediately of any allegations made against an overseas organisation for which any part of HMG [the government] bears responsibility and which is ***.\u201d Despite the reports findings, some members of the committee warned against any attempt by government to use it to justify greater surveillance powers and were concerned about the government\u2019s handling of the report this week. ISC member and Liberal Democrat MP Sir Ming Campbell said: \u201cIt is a remarkable coincidence, some might say, that the home secretary should have chosen to make public her further proposals on the eve of the publication of the ISC report. No doubt the purpose of doing so was to link her proposals to the committee\u2019s conclusions. The committee never considered those proposals.\u201d ISC member Julian Lewis, a Tory MP, condemned leaks claiming the report would support greater powers on communications data. He said: \u201cNothing in our report is relevant to that argument\u201d. In Woolwich at the site of Rigby\u2019s murder outside his barracks, a memorial was still in place. Enda Mcniffe, a 22-year-old student who has lived in Woolwich all his life, said the community now shared a real sense of fear, but that it had \u201cgrown stronger\u201d after the attack. \u201cFrom what I read at the time, there was information circulating about [the killers before the murder] and I thought it could have been acted on a bit more,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it was going to happen, if not to poor Lee Rigby then to someone else.\u201d \u2022 Additional reporting by Nicholas Watt and Haroon Siddique\n", "title": "Lee Rigby murder: Facebook could have picked up killer\u2019s message - report"}, {"date": "2013-11-12T09:04:06Z", "body": "World leaders have been understanding about leaked revelations that the US spied on them as they know it was not all done under the orders of Barack Obama, the US secretary of state has said. In an interview with the BBC, John Kerry said foreign governments understood the president did not personally authorise all the surveillance, which included tapping the mobile phone of the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. Asked about the talks held with foreign leaders over the revelations, Kerry said they had been \"very respectful, very understanding. We're all trying to find a way forward that respects privacy, rights, that fights terrorism, that doesn't interfere with people.\" Earlier, Kerry acknowledged that the leaders had legitimate questions about the extent of National Security Agency (NSA) phone and internet surveillance revealed in stories by the Guardian and other newspapers based on documents leaked by the whistleblower Edward Snowden. There has been public outrage about the spying in some European countries, leading them to demand information from the US about the extent of its spying on its allies. Kerry told the BBC: \"The president has ordered a full review into what we're doing. People understand that the president didn't order all these things, this happened over a long period of time, it's been an evolutionary process, we now need to define it more effectively and that's what the president is setting out to do.\" Kerry also revealed that talks with Iran at the weekend over its nuclear capabilities had come \"very, very close to a deal, extremely close\". \"I think we were separated by four or five different formulations of particular concepts, but none so terribly that I don't think it's possible to reach agreement. \"The fact is, we had a unity on Saturday in a proposal put forward in front of the Iranians, but because of the changes, they thought we should go back and change it. What's critical is, it has to be absolutely clear to the world that it isn't a nuclear weapons programme. They have to see there is a standard by which they might be able to do something. We just talked more in 38 hours than the best part of 30 years.\"\n", "title": "John Kerry: world leaders have been understanding about NSA leaks"}, {"date": "2016-03-18T12:11:35Z", "body": "The US government is heavily invested in an internal surveillance program that is unsustainable, ineffective, morally reprehensible, inherently dangerous and ultimately counterproductive. In the months following the US government\u2019s initial charges against me over the release of government records in 2010, the current administration formed the National Insider Threat Task Force under the authority of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and several other US government agencies. The mission of this taskforce is breathtakingly broad. It aims at deterring threats to national security by anyone \u201cwho misuses or betrays, wittingly or unwittingly, his or her authorized access to any US Government resource\u201d. Unfortunately, the methods it outlines amount to thousands of government personnel being effectively under total surveillance. These kinds of operations usually result in doing more harm than good. As articulated by James Detert and Ethan Burris in a recent Harvard Business Review article, such training and surveillance programs greatly diminish productive and innovative capabilities within organizations. They have a tendency to \u201cpromote fear of embarrassment, isolation, low performance ratings, lost promotions, and even firing\u201d. When your employer is the US government, that fear \u2013 of surveillance, public humiliation, warrants, arrest, trial, exorbitant legal fees and imprisonment \u2013 is orders of magnitude higher. Flaws in the program exacerbate these problems. There is a reliance on \u201canonymous feedback\u201d which can create endless witch-hunts, \u201cgeneral invitations\u201d to report or file complaints through so-called open door policies, and vagueness about what feedback is expected. According to Deter and Burris, the program creates a perfect storm of conditions against innovation, creativity and whistleblowing. The implementation of the Insider Threat program has shown predictably troubling results. For example, an ODNI webinar, entitled Simple Steps and Guidance to Secure Classified Networks, describes excessive surveillance protocols and invasive secret investigations by the US government and military into their own officials. In its early stages, it has become clear that this program conflates any attempt to seek redress, transparency or the promotion of legitimate public interests with grave threats to national security. The program will have tangible effects on the lives of many officials. For instance, over the period of several years, a former senior government official, Thomas Drake, repeatedly attempted through many official and internal channels \u2013 including inspectors general and the US congressional intelligence committees \u2013 to prompt scrutiny of some questionable NSA programs. After getting nowhere, he finally communicated his unclassified concerns to a reporter. Drake was then investigated for nearly half a decade, and charged with violations under the broadly interpreted Espionage Act of 1917. In 2011 he pled guilty to a federal misdemeanor after accruing hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal defense fees. However, the Insider Threat program wasn\u2019t done with Drake, nor others like him. Late last year, the ODNI released internal training material that characterized Drake, and other government officials, as threats akin to the Fort Hood and Navy Yard mass shooters. When this revelation was made public, a letter from 22 civil liberties and press freedom organizations decried the government\u2019s \u201cwanton misuse of the term \u2018threat\u2019\u201d and their failure to \u201cunderstand the distinction between a whistleblower and a genuine threat\u201d. As evidenced by a slideshow obtained in February 2016 through a Foia request, internal training material based on my own psychological profile and history \u2013 using male pronouns and my old name, despite it being legally changed in April 2014 \u2013 has been widely published and presented. The program alleges that I am \u201cdisgruntled\u201d based on my perceived sexual orientation and gender identity, questioning my \u201cself-image as a man\u201d while acknowledging that \u201che [sic] wanted to be an openly accepted female\u201d. It describes me as \u201can advocate for homosexuals openly serving\u201d in the military, and my concern and advocacy of queer and trans rights as being expressed \u201cobsessively\u201d. The broad sweep of the program means officials have been given a blank check for surveillance. Agencies implementing the Insider Threat program could examine anyone who has motives of \u201cgreed\u201d, \u201cfinancial difficulties\u201d, is \u201cdisgruntled\u201d, has \u201can ideology\u201d a \u201cdivided loyalty\u201d, an \u201cego\u201d or \u201cself-image\u201d, or \u201cany family/personal issues\u201d \u2013 the words used to describe my motives. Such subjective labelling could easily be applied to virtually every single person currently holding a security clearance. This lack of focus has already led to the program becoming industrialized. In an April 2015 report to the US House armed services committee, the US Department of Defense revealed the existence of \u201ccontinuing evaluation\u201d of 100,000 personnel on and off the job. The Insider Threat program works against innovation, creativity and the prevention of institutional corruption. Perhaps this is the real intent of the intelligence community and the Insider Threat Task Force \u2013 to instill fear and project dominance throughout the intelligence community, the military, and among government employees and contractors at large. Perhaps a better approach for the government would be to create a Transparency and Accountability Task Force, comprising different government agencies and departments, the inspectors general, the National Archives and Office of Government Information Services, and a committee or other body that can work directly with current and former government employees, service members, veterans and journalists. Such a taskforce could focus on advocating for and protecting employees who have concerns. It would help to send a message to employees, military service members, contractors and department and agency heads that even if the official channels fail, those who raise concerns will still be protected, listened to and given the chance to speak out in a meaningful forum. It would encourage dissent. It would allow dirty laundry, drama and corruption to be aired out rather than allowed to fester. We could all \u2013 citizens, the government and its employees \u2013 benefit from that.\n", "title": "When will the US government stop persecuting whistleblowers? | Chelsea Manning"}, {"date": "2014-02-11T18:13:39Z", "body": "As you cruise the internet, check Facebook or shoot out a few tweets today, you might notice something strange: a massive digital protest aimed at stopping the NSA surveillance machine. Over 6,000 organizations, companies and websites have pledged their support to roll back the surveillance state by inundating members of Congress with calls, emails, tweets and Facebook posts in support of the USA Freedom Act, a bill with nearly 150 bipartisan cosponsors that would end the bulk collection of Americans\u2019 sensitive records. Today is The Day We Fight Back. But to fight back effectively, Americans need to know where the facts stand right now, more than eight months since the Edward Snowden leaks began. Within minutes after the Guardian published that first leak on the NSA\u2019s activities, pro-surveillance forces starting making bold claims about how necessary broad spying is to our very security. And almost every justification for indiscriminate spying on Americans and people abroad has been methodically refuted ever since. It turns out that assertions made by the administration, members of Congress and security commentators were little more than myths. So enough with the misleading statements and half-truths designed to distort reality. Here\u2019s a quick rundown and rebuttal of the surveillance falsehoods that still need refuting to this day. Myth No 1: NSA surveillance programs have thwarted terror attacks here at home. At early congressional hearings, administration representatives insisted that spying programs, including the now infamous collection of phone records in bulk, had stopped 54 terror incidents. As members pushed for more detail, the administration said around 10 of those were based in the US. Weeks later, the number shrank to four - and then ultimately a single case in Southern California, where a San Diego cab driver was convicted of sending $8,500 to a Somali terrorist group. In fact, there were no attacks in America thwarted by domestic spying. This led both the independent Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board and the president\u2019s hand-picked Surveillance Review Group to find that the phone records program added no unique value to the many surveillance programs already underway. Myth No 2: NSA data-crunching programs only work if you collect all information on everyone. Pro-surveillance advocates immediately took up this banner once it was reported that essentially all phone calls in the US were collected under provisions of the Patriot Act. Of course, this argument fell apart once no cases could be found supporting the need for bulk collection. The claim was also dealt a serious blow by the conclusion of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board that bulk collection has not provided the NSA any information that it could not have acquired using targeted surveillance. The Washington Post and Wall Street Journal are now reporting that the collection rate of phone records is somewhere between 20 and 30% and is largely targeted at landlines. If this is true, the \u201ccollect-it-all\u201d argument has no leg to stand on. Myth No 3: All relevant decision-makers were briefed on the programs and approved them. Some members of Congress were briefed on the telephone record program, but by and large they were not. In fact, the House Intelligence Committee is still denying members of the House access to information about NSA surveillance to this very day. The rest of the newly revealed programs - such as a decade-long program to track email communications, overseas hacking and broad searches of internet records - have not been addressed by the administration in any detail. Most members of Congress are unaware of how these and even broader programs affect people here and abroad. Myth No 4: There\u2019s simply no other less-intrusive way to achieve the same ends. It\u2019s not clear what the \u201cends\u201d are since they don\u2019t seem to be tied to actually stopping terrorist attacks. But if the NSA\u2019s goal is to collect phone and other records to advance investigations, the government has many tools already at its disposal that operate with some sort of specificity or suspicion, including emergency authorities that allow them to seize records and follow process later if life or limb is at risk. Both the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board and the president\u2019s Review Group confirmed this in their respective reports. Myth No 5: President Obama\u2019s changes sufficiently address the privacy violations revealed in the last eight months. The president\u2019s apparent decision to stop the NSA from amassing Americans\u2019 phone records without suspicion is a good first step but addresses only the tip of the iceberg. Notably absent from the president\u2019s recent speech on surveillance was a commitment to end other forms of bulk collection. Congress needs to finish the job by rewriting the laws to ensure that no records or communications can be collected in a mass, suspicion-free fashion and that the government\u2019s tools be targeted only at those suspected of wrongdoing. Moreover, Congress needs to address the significant way in which international and foreign surveillance affects the rights of not just US citizens and residents, but of foreigners, whose right to privacy the president recently recognized. Part of the solution will undoubtedly involve clarifying and adding appropriate limitations on vague surveillance laws and executive orders. Now that you know where the truth stands, the administration and its supporters are left only with claims that trolling through our data provides \u201cpeace of mind\u201d and that someday in the future these massive databases will somehow thwart a terrorist attack. Those are inadequate justifications for widespread spying on everyday people, particularly in a democracy. That\u2019s why the ACLU and over 6,000 other organizations, companies and websites are taking action. Today we tell our members of Congress that the time has come to take our privacy back and rein in the NSA by passing the USA Freedom Act. Join us, and tell Congress that indiscriminate mass surveillance is un-American.\n", "title": "Five surveillance myths stalling NSA reform, debunked | Michelle Richardson"}, {"date": "2013-11-07T09:26:27Z", "body": "The three heads of the British intelligence agencies are to make an unprecedented public televised appearance in front of the intelligence and security committee of MPs where they will seek to justify the scale of their surveillance activities. Before the 90-minute hearing on Thursday afternoon, the former head of GCHQ Sir David Omand claimed the effectiveness of the committee itself was as much on show as the spy chiefs themselves. The session, subject to a two-minute TV delay to avoid secrets inadvertently being broadcast, was agreed before news of mass surveillance by the UK and US was leaked by Edward Snowden, the former US National Security Agency contractor. It will feature the head of MI6, Sir John Sawers, his MI5 counterpart, Andrew Parker, and Sir Iain Lobban, head of the secretive GCHQ. Apart from a test of the system of parliamentary accountability, the session is likely to be a forum for the heads of the agencies to condemn the leaks, and justify the scale of their intelligence operations in the digital age. Lobban has mounted a strong defence of his staff, saying they \"spend their lives protecting the security of Britain and the safety of British citizens\". Omand accused the former Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald and other reporters of \"dodging around the issue of damage to public security\". He asserted: \"As a result of the revelations we know less about the people who are trying to harm us and we are therefore less safe.\" He urged journalists to to be honest about the damage. If there was such an admission, it would be possible to have a debate, he said. \"I have argued for a long time that the government should have been more open about the purpose of intelligence and the general ways in an internet age you have to go about accessing intelligence. That debate is perfectly reasonable.\" He rejected as nonsense claims in the Guardian that one reason why the intelligence agencies had argued against the use of intercept evidence in court trials was because it wished to keep secret the scale of its intelligence gathering. Omand said he was proud of the British collaboration with American intelligence agencies, saying: \"We have the brains, they have the money.\" He added that it was an open matter of debate about how GCHQ was funded by the US. He was sure, he said, that the committee would have had detailed briefings on the scale of GCHQ's activity, but in private. \"The ISC has now been reconstituted. It is now a proper committee of parliament. They have got new powers. They are on show this afternoon every bit as much as the three heads of agencies. They have to demonstrate they can satisfy the need for oversight and satisfy parliament that they are doing a job that in other areas of government can be done by much more open means.\" Greenwald challenged the performance of the ISC, saying: \"I think the system has failed to exercise meaningful accountability up to this point because there was a huge suspicionless system of mass spying that the British and American people had no idea had been built in their name. But I think that system can bring about real accountability if there is the political will.\" He challenged claims that the Guardian's journalism had damaged national security, saying no evidence had yet been produced to justify these assertions. In a speech to the defence industry, reported by the Sun, Lobban said his agents had \"definitively saved the lives\" of British troops abroad. \"I'm fiercely proud of GCHQ's people, past and present,\" he said. In a sign of the nervous attitude, Richard Barrett, the former head of counter-terrorism at MI6, insisted the ISC session would not lead to fireworks. \"This session will be one that is collaborative rather than confrontational. I don't think that the parliament in the UK thinks that the intelligence agencies have been up to no good. I think that quite rightly they believe that they've been properly regulated and following the law as it applies to them. \"I don't think we'll get a whole load of questions that are aggressively put and seeking to trip up the heads of the agencies.\" The ISC has said the session will cover \"the terrorist threat, regional instability and weapons proliferation, cyber security and espionage\" but not ongoing operations or cases.

When Oliver asked: \u201cHow many of those documents have you actually read?\u201d Snowden responded: \u201cI\u2019ve evaluated all the documents that are in the archive.\u201d When pressed, he said \u201cWell, I do understand what I turned over,\u201d and acknowledged: \u201cI recognize the concern\u201d about whether he knew enough of the documents\u2019 details or technical abilities of journalists to protect certain details. Oliver then asked Snowden not whether his actions were right or wrong but whether they could be dangerous simply due to the incompetence of others. The Last Week Tonight host claimed that the improper redaction of a document by the New York Times exposed intelligence activity against al-Qaida. \u201cThat is a problem,\u201d Snowden replied. \u201cWell, that\u2019s a fuck-up,\u201d Oliver shot back, forcing Snowden to agree. \u201cThat is a fuck-up,\u201d Snowden replied. \u201cThose things do happen in reporting. In journalism we have to accept that some mistakes will be made. This is a fundamental concept of liberty.\u201d \u201cBut you have to own that then,\u201d Oliver replied. \u201cYou\u2019re giving documents with information that you know could be harmful which could get out there ... We\u2019re not even talking about bad faith, we\u2019re talking about incompetence.\u201d Seeming surprised by the conversation\u2019s turn, Snowden \u2013 whose leaks of thousands of documents to Guardian journalists led to controversy around the world \u2013 slowly conceded that his actions carried dangers regardless of his intentions or competence. \u201cBut you will never be completely free from risk if you\u2019re free,\u201d he persisted. \u201cThe only time you can be free from risk is when you\u2019re in prison.\u201d The comedian also confronted Snowden with the problem of American apathy towards his actions and the mass surveillance he uncovered. Americans don\u2019t care about invisible NSA overreach in the complex warrens of the internet, Oliver argued. \u201cIt\u2019s like the IT guy comes into your office and it\u2019s like: \u2018Oh shit, don\u2019t teach me anything\u2019,\u201d Oliver groaned. \u201cIs it a conversation that we have the capacity to have? Because it\u2019s so complicated.\u201d But if Americans understood that the hands of the NSA had latched on to their explicit photography, people would riot, Oliver suggested. \u201cWell, the good news is there\u2019s no program named the \u2018dick pic program\u2019,\u201d replied Snowden. \u201cThe bad news is they\u2019re still collecting everybody\u2019s information, including your dick pics.\u201d Snowden linked Americans\u2019 habit of sending each other explicit photos to a broader pitch about courage and liberty: \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t change your behavior because a government agency somewhere is doing the wrong thing.\u201d Oliver also joked with Snowden about whether he misses Hot Pockets and Florida. Snowden said he missed the former very much; of the latter he revealed nothing. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 April 2015.

In a 6,500 word profile for the news site Buzzfeed, Miranda gives a detailed account of his detention under Britain's counter-terrorism laws at the airport on 18 August, when he was in transit on a flight from Berlin where he had met the film-maker Laura Poitras who has been involved breaking revelations based on documents leaked by Snowden. Buzzfeed reports: One of the agents asked Miranda for the passwords to his cell phone, laptop, and flash drive. When Miranda did not respond, agents grew sterner and told him again that under the Terrorism Act he could be sent to prison for not cooperating with their requests. Miranda relented. \u201cI became scared at that moment because I know that people get disappeared by the US and UK governments if they claim you\u2019re a terrorist,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the encryption keys to allow access to the documents, but I did tell them my passwords to my personal phone and laptop.\u201d Despite the ordeal Miranda, who is now in Rio de Janeiro, added: I think what Snowden did was heroic.

Snowden has shared somewhere between 50 (thousand) and 200,000 documents with reporters. These will continue to come out.\nWelcome to our hub for all Edward Snowden, NSA and GCHQ-related developments around the world. As arguments rage over how much of our day to day life should be monitored in the name of security, we'll be tracking the growing global debate about privacy in the digital age. We'd like to know what you think about the whole NSA story, what you're worried about \u2013 and any new areas you'd like to read more about. Here's a roundup of the latest developments: \u2022 The New York Times has defended the Guardian in the face \"government bullying\" over the publication of Edward Snowden's disclosures about the scope of state surveillance. In an editorial it said: Parliamentary committees and the police are now exploiting that lack of protection to harass, intimidate and possibly prosecute The Guardian newspaper for its publication of information based on National Security Agency documents that were leaked by Edward Snowden. The New York Times has published similar material, believing that the public has a clear interest in learning about and debating the N.S.A.\u2019s out-of-control spying on private communications. That interest is shared by the British public as well. In the United States, some members of Congress have begun pushing for stronger privacy protections against unwarranted snooping. British parliamentarians have largely ducked their duty to ask tough questions of British intelligence agencies, which closely collaborate with the N.S.A., and have gone after The Guardian instead. Alan Rusbridger, the newspaper\u2019s editor, has been summoned to appear before a parliamentary committee next month to testify about The Guardian\u2019s internal editorial decision-making regarding the Snowden information. Members of Parliament have also demanded information on the newspaper\u2019s decision to make some of the leaked information available to other journalists, including those at The Times. That should be none of Parliament\u2019s business. Meanwhile, Scotland Yard detectives are pursuing a criminal investigation into The Guardian\u2019s actions surrounding the Snowden leaks. These alarming developments threaten the ability of British journalists to do their jobs effectively. Britain\u2019s press has long lacked the freedoms enjoyed by American newspapers. Now it appears they are less free from government interference than journalists in Germany, where Der Spiegel has published material from the Snowden leaks without incurring government bullying. The global debate now taking place about intelligence agencies collecting information on the phone calls, emails and Internet use of private citizens owes much to The Guardian\u2019s intrepid journalism. In a free society, the price for printing uncomfortable truths should not be parliamentary and criminal inquisition. \u2022 David Cameron has repeated his claim that Snowden's revelations have been a help to terrorists and organised criminals, after being challenged on the scope GCHQ's surveillance during a Q&A session with students in the Indian city of Kolkata. Asked by one student whether the scandal about Project Tempora, GCHQ's programme to tap subsea internet cables, had damaged the government, Cameron defended the need for spying to keep the country safe from bombings such as the attacks on London and Mumbai. \"It is perfectly legitimate for countries to have intelligence and security organisations. Our job as government, our first priority is national security \u2026 when you think of the horrendous attacks in Mumbai or London and other parts of the UK like Manchester, if we can take steps to prevent those attacks happening you should take those steps.\" Cameron said there was a danger with \"damaging\" revelations, such as Snowden's leaks, of \"helping the terrorists, of helping organised criminals\". He said there was \"pretty good\" oversight of the intelligence agencies and the UK was not closed-minded to improving governance. However, Cameron added: \"But let's not be naive and think we live in a world where you don't need intelligence and security. We do.\" \u2022 Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander has stopped short of defending the Guardian over the publication of Snowden's leaks. In an interview for the Politics Weekly podcast he said: \"It is for the Guardian to justify their conduct, it is for politicians to justify ours.\" He added: \"I'm not in a position to judge on the extent to which [the Guardian's disclosures have] compromised individual investigations that were under way ... There is a heavy responsibility on the government to make sure that systems are secure where information is contained. The primary responsibility rests with the government to make sure that they are offering the assurances that are required and the explanations that are needed. Speaking last week, ahead of the appearance of the Britain's intelligence chiefs before the intelligence and security committee, Alexander said he did not want to \"rush to judgement\" over whether oversight of the intelligence services needed reform. He said: \"There are processes under way to look at these issues. A responsible opposition recognises that what matters actually is the policy, because that's what will determines what is the appropriate balance between liberty and security. He added: \"Part of the vital task of our intelligence agencies is contingent upon sustaining the consent and support of the British public.\n\u2022 The CIA is collecting records of international money transfers under the same law that the NSA uses to collect Americans' phone and Internet records, according to the New York Times and Wall Street Journal. The data, which includes records from companies such as Western Union Co, is part of a database of financial and personal information authorized under the Patriot Act, the newspapers reported, citing unnamed current and former government officials. The data does not include transfers within the borders of the United States or bank-to-bank transactions, they said. The CIA declined to comment on the specifics but said its operations comply with the law. \u2022 The NSA and the Department of Homeland Security have threatened legal action to block the sale of t-shirts that ridicule the agencies, Voice of America reports. One t-shirt calls the NSA the \u201conly part of the government that actually listens,\u201d a joke that plays on the NSA\u2019s controversial, and critics say overzealous, monitoring of communications worldwide.

The annual index of media freedom, published on Wednesday, attributes the UK's drop to \"negative developments\", mainly the way the government responded last year to the Guardian with threats of legal action, the destruction of computer hard drives and the nine-hour detention of David Miranda, the partner of journalist Glenn Greenwald. Freedom of Press 2014 is published by the US-based Freedom House, an NGO established in 1941 that has been ranking countries worldwide since 1980 in relation to democracy, human rights and press freedom.\nClick here to see a larger pdf of the map The organisation said press freedom had fallen to its lowest level for over a decade. It partly blames regressive steps in countries such as Egypt, Libya, Jordan, Turkey and Ukraine, as well as the actions taken against journalists reporting on national security issues in both the US and UK. Karin Karlekar, the report's project director, said: \"We see declines in media freedom on a global level, driven by governments' efforts to control the message and punish the messenger.\" Of the 197 countries and territories assessed during 2013, 63 were rated free, 68 partly free and 66 not free.\nBritain has dropped from 31st place last year to 36th, ranking it alongside Malta and Slovakia. \"Significant decline took place in Turkey, which fell into the 'not free' category, as well as in Greece, Montenegro and the United Kingdom,\" Freedom House said. Snowden, who worked for both the CIA and the NSA, leaked tens of thousands of secret documents to the Guardian and the Washington Post. The revelations about the scope of surveillance sparked a worldwide debate about the balance between national security and privacy. The British government took a more draconian approach than the US, threatening legal action and sending two members of GCHQ to the Guardian's head office to watch over the destruction of the hard drives which had contained the leaked documents as well as reporters' stories. Miranda was held for nine hours at Heathrow en route from Berlin to his home in Rio de Janeiro. Countries are ranked from zero to 100 in terms of press freedom, with the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden at the top, each on 10, and North Korea at the bottom, on 97. Britain remains in the \"free\" category but is on 23 points, down from 21. The drop would have been much sharper but was partly balanced by what Freedom House viewed as a positive development in reforming the libel law. Countries drop into the 'partly free' category if they drop to 31 points.\nThe British intelligence services claim the disclosures in the Guardian have created serious damage to their ability to monitor terrorists. Stephen Phipson, a director at the office for security and counter-terrorism, said at a security conference in London on Tuesday that terrorists had substantially changed their methods of communications as a result of the leaks. \"Our adversaries, the terrorists out there, now have full sight of the sorts of tools and range of techniques that are being used by government,\" he said. \"I can tell you data shows a substantial reduction in the use of those methods of communication as a result of the Snowden leaks.\" The US also dropped down the Freedom House rankings, from 18 points to 21. Freedom House cited federal government efforts to curb reporters covering national security issues. \"However, a number of negative developments stemmed from the government's response to the revelations of surveillance by the NSA and its British counterpart GCHQ,\" the report says. \"Authorities used the Terrorism Act to detain the partner of investigative journalist Glenn Greenwald, who broke the story; raided the offices of the Guardian newspaper and destroyed hard drives containing potentially sensitive source material; and subsequently threatened the Guardian with further action.\"\n", "title": "UK slips down global press freedom list due to Snowden leaks response"}, {"date": "2014-05-13T13:01:00Z", "body": "Media professor Julian Petley has written a lengthy assessment of the way in which The Guardian's revelations NSA and GCHQ surveillance were covered by the rest of the press. \"The State journalism is in: Edward Snowden and the British press\" was published first in the journal Ethical Space*. Now it has been serialised in the Inforrm blog (here and here and here). Here's a brief look at the third extract by Petley, professor of screen media at Brunel university and chair of the Campaign for Press and Broadcasting Freedom, in which he argues that the overarching theme in the press campaign against The Guardian was national security. He begins by considering an article in the Daily Mail last October, headed \"The Guardian has produced a 'handbook' that will help fanatics strike at will\", with sub-decks saying: \"Security officials say there was no public interest in Guardian's expos\u00e9\" and \"They also claim terrorists now know where and where not to communicate.\" He notes that the piece \"is dependent entirely upon anonymous 'security officials' and 'Whitehall insiders'\" and continues: \"[They] claim variously that 'the publication of the documents stolen by Edward Snowden is considered to have done more damage to the security services than any other event in history', that 'there was no public interest in publishing top-secret information which details the precise methods used by agents to track terrorist plots', that 'fanatics were signposted to the places they should avoid when communicating', and that 'The Guardian had helped to produce a \"handbook\" for terrorists'.\" These anonymous quotes are highly contentious, writes Petley, \"yet there is not the slightest attempt to quote opposing or even merely sceptical viewpoints.\" He goes on to list other examples in the Mail and The Sun. He then points to a Sunday Telegraph column by Tory MP, and former defence secretary, Liam Fox, in which he called for legal action against The Guardian. He is also quoted in a Telegraph news story in the same issue suggesting that The Guardian may have breached the Terrorism Act 2000. Petley comments: \"In any other democratic country, such threats to journalists would immediately be the subject of stories and indignant comment in most newspapers, but in Britain the threats are made in and, effectively, by, newspapers themselves. There is, unfortunately, absolutely nothing new about this \u2013 the majority of Britain's national press has a long and deeply dishonourable history when it comes to attacking those few journalists brave enough not to be cowed the moment 'national security' or the 'national interest' are mentioned, and fortunate enough to work for those few media organisations which will facilitate their work. Most newspapers are far more likely to endorse attempts by the state to censor such journalism than they are to condemn them.\" He points out that \"public debate about Snowden... turned as much, if not more, upon the behaviour of a newspaper as opposed to that of GCHQ and the NSA.\" To endorse his point, Petley approvingly quotes The Guardian's Jonathan Freedland: \"Americans genuinely believe their government is meant to work for them, that it should be their servant, not their master... That is why the NSA revelations are so shocking to Americans... they expose an arm of government acting without the permission, or indeed the knowledge, of the American people and their representatives in Congress.\" \"In Britain, by contrast, the people are not sovereign... We are used to power flowing from the top down, from the centre outward, and most of the time we accept it... \"If an arm of the state insists on total secrecy, that seems reasonable to Brits in a way few Americans would ever accept. It's not a natural instinct for Britons to see, say, GCHQ as their employees.\" *Ethical Space, Vol 11/1-2, 2014\n", "title": "Media academic attacks press campaign against The Guardian over Snowden leaks"}, {"date": "2013-10-16T20:00:01Z", "body": "The impact of government surveillance on legal confidentiality goes further than undermining civil actions against the state (Spies accused of ignoring MPs, 16 October). Every person accused of crime, terrorism or immigration matters who is legally represented is in contact with their lawyers, so if the government monitors the target they will be monitoring legal communications. Lawyers have to discuss their clients' cases, send and receive instructions etc. It's impractical to use an office phone/website every time or demand the client come in to discuss this in private \u2013 and there are cases where even the fact of the client attending an appointment is an issue. So lawyers and their agents, like myself, use their own phones, we often give the police our contact details and trust that Big Brother isn't going to abuse this by monitoring these, especially when I report back to the instructing solicitor or the advocate representing the client at court what the case is about, assess the evidence, say what the client's instructions were. In short, surveillance affects defence solicitors in every immigration/criminal/terrorism case. Anil Bhatt Sunderland \u2022 You report the comments of Lord Blencathra and Nick Brown MP as to information they did not receive from the intelligence agencies during hearings of the parliamentary committee chaired by Lord Blencathra on the proposed communications data bill. Your report suggests information was \"hidden from MPs\". In fact, two parliamentary committees were taking evidence on this issue. While Lord Blencathra took considerable evidence regarding the police and law enforcement bodies, the intelligence and security committee took evidence from the intelligence agencies on secret matters and had access to classified material which the other parliamentary committee could not. Arising from that evidence, we reported to parliament that the intelligence and security agencies already have access to communicartions data, and had less immediate need than the police and other law enforcement agencies for the proposed bill \"because they are able to work around the problem through the use of other national security capabilities\" under existing legislation. These comments in our published report reflected the evidence that we had received Malcolm Rifkind MP Chairman, intelligence and security committee \u2022 In light of your editorial (16 October), I would like to point out that parliament recently had the opportunity to debate the democratic accountability of the security services, during the passage of the Justice and Security Act. Both Yvette Cooper and I argued for extensive reform of the intelligence and security committee, including for the chair to be a member of the opposition and for there to be a majority of democratically elected MPs as members of the committee. We also pressed for pre-appointment hearings for heads of security agencies, for more public sessions and for greater investigative capacity for the ISC. The shadow home secretary has also set out plans to reform the commissioners system because gone are the days of paper-based accountability checks. The coalition parties, including the Lib Dems, had an opportunity to support all of these proposals and include them. They chose not to back Labour's plans. Diana Johnson MP Shadow crime and security minister \u2022 Boris Johnson needs to make up his mind on undercover cops and sex (Report, 15 October). City Hall's police committee has been told by him and the head of the Met, Bernard Hogan-Howe, that it's not acceptable for undercover police to have sex with the people they are targeting and that pre-authorisation for a sexual relationship would never be given. But the mayor is using public money to pay for the Met's lawyers to argue in court this week that undercover police could be and were authorised to have sexual relationships. There is a significant difference between what the mayor is saying to the media and what his lawyers are saying in court. This is symptomatic of the complete confusion the Met has on this issue. I hope in the interests of transparency and justice the women are successful in their appeal. Jenny Jones Green party group, London assembly \u2022 Years ago we had one or two headline stories about spies, with Maclean, Philby, Blake, Burgess et al all exposed and condemned. Now, the only \"spies\" we hear about are the ones who voluntarily broadcast their secrets. So with one low-ranked US army recruit and a contractor who is not even enlisted in the US forces, we are told that some of the most serious leaks of US/UK intelligence in modern times has occurred, representing a major threat to the security of our countries. Well, if these two can dig up this stuff, goodness knows\u00a0what is accessible to the real spies\u00a0these days. These events prove that our (UK/US and others) security services are useless when it comes to preventing access to classified information. It also suggests that undesirable agents can probably find a way to access and copy files of internet traffic metadata and interrogate these for their own evil ends. And, somehow, at the very top of our governments, the actions of Manning and Snowden are being condemned while any real security leaks are, no doubt, never reported. Now that these two have alerted us all to the potential frailties of the security systems, we need proper governance and regulation to protect the public, not just serve the interests of those who gather and manipulate this \"information\".

Writing for the Guardian, the whistleblower behind the National Security Agency leaks suggests he carefully framed the question to Putin, which he asked via video link in an annual televised call-in with the president on Thursday. Putin, Snowden writes, \u201cdenied the first part of the question and dodged on the latter\u201d. In the phone-in, Snowden asked Putin: \"Does Russia intercept, store or analyse, in any way, the communications of millions of individuals?\" Putin replied: \"Our intelligence efforts are strictly regulated by our law... We don't have a mass system of such interception and \u2013 according with our law \u2013it cannot exist.\"\nThe wording was deliberately modelled, Snowden says, on the query of US senator Ron Wyden to the director of national intelligence, James Clapper, in March last year \u2013 almost three months before the NSA disclosures began \u2013 to which Clapper blatantly and inaccurately denied that the US government collected data on millions on Americans. \u201cThe question was intended to mirror the now infamous exchange between Senator Ron Wyden and DNI James Clapper\u2026 and to invite either an important concession or a clear evasion\u201d from Putin, Snowden writes. Snowden\u2019s decision to take part in Putin\u2019s annual live session, which traditionally features softball questions, prompted an outpouring of criticism against the former NSA contractor. He is in exile in Russia having been charged with three felonies by the US government in relation to the leak, including one count under the Espionage Act. Stewart Baker, the NSA\u2019s former general counsel, attacked Snowden in a post for Volokh Conspiracy blog on the Washington Post headlined \u201cSnowden self-incriminates\u201d. Baker wrote: \u201cIt sure looks as though Snowden is playing the Kremlin\u2019s game here, serving up a pre-arranged softball on demand.\u201d Edward Lucas, a senior editor at the Economist who has attacked the leaker in an e-book called The Snowden Operation, told the Wall Street Journal the appearance had made him \u201clook like a propaganda patsy of the Kremlin\u201d. Lucas added that given how careful Snowden had been on this question, \u201cit seems almost reckless. This raises all sorts of questions about the real conditions of his stay in Russia and his relationship with the Kremlin.\u201d Even some Snowden supporters voiced unease at his participation in the event. Jillian York, the director of international free expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who has previously given numerous public talks in support of Snowden and the NSA revelations, tweeted: \u201cSnowden's question WAS softball. If he knows as much as he claims, he would've known that the wording gave Putin an easy out.\u201d\nBut in his article, which was given to the Guardian via the Freedom of the Press Foundation, on whose board Snowden sits, Snowden says such criticism was a simple misinterpretation of what he had been trying to do. He emphasises that he has sworn no allegiance to Russia and has no ulterior motive. \u201cI expected that some would object to my participation in an annual forum that is largely comprised of softball questions to a leader unaccustomed to being challenged. But to me, the rare opportunity to lift a taboo on discussion of state surveillance before an audience that primarily views state media outweighed that risk.\u201d Snowden says that before state officials in any country can be held accountable, \u201cwe must first give them an opportunity to make those claims\u201d. He said he was motivated by a belief that mass surveillance was a threat to people everywhere, not just in the US. \u201cLast year, I risked family, life, and freedom to help initiate a global debate that even [Barack] Obama himself conceded 'will make our nation stronger'.

The news, the latest extracted from documents supplied to media outlets including the Guardian by the former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, was reported on Saturday by the German magazine Der Spiegel and The Intercept, a website set up by the former Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald with the support of the founder of eBay, Pierre Omidyar. Der Spiegel said the NSA kept more than 300 reports on Merkel in a special databank concerning heads of state, including the leaders of Peru, Somalia, Guatemala, Colombia and Belarus. The new reports are based on a document from the NSA's Center for Contract Extraction, which carries out automated analysis of collected text data. Der Spiegel said that the document, from 2009, appeared to contain the names of 122 world leaders, listed in alphabetical order from Abdullah Badawi, a former Malaysian prime minister, to Yulia Tymoshenko, the Ukrainian prime minister at the time. The magazine said the document indicated Merkel was included in a \u201cso-called 'Target Knowledge Database'\u201d. Reports of American surveillance of the German leader are not new. In October, Der Spiegel reported that the NSA had monitored Merkel's mobile phone for as long as 10 years. The news caused considerable diplomatic embarrassment for President Barack Obama, particularly over the question of whether he had known of such surveillance. The NSA said he had not. In December, it was reported that, in a conversation with Obama, Merkel compared the NSA to the Stasi, the security and surveillance organisation of communist East Germany. Earlier this month, German lawmakers agreed to launch an inquiry into surveillance by the NSA and other foreign intelligence services. German federal prosecutors may also open an investigation. Saturday's reports also said the British spy agency, GCHQ, infiltrated servers run by German internet companies and eavesdropped on staff communications, and that in March 2013 the NSA obtained a court order to spy on Germany. GCHQ and NSA surveillance of German targets has also been reported before. Reports based on documents provided by Snowden, who was granted a year's asylum in Russia, continue to be published regularly. Last Saturday, Der Spiegel and the New York Times reported that the NSA placed \u201cback doors\u201d in products made by the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei, a company which US politicians have criticised for allegedly aiding cyber-espionage by China. In the US, fallout from Snowden's leaks to the media has mainly been felt domestically. On Thursday, amidst competing reform proposals, Obama formally proposed ending the collection of bulk telephone data by the NSA. This week also saw the retirement of General Keith Alexander, the head of the NSA and Cyber Command, and the announcement that Mike Rogers, the Republican chairman of the House of Representatives intelligence committee and a key congressional NSA ally, will retire in order to pursue a career in conservative talk radio.\n", "title": "NSA listed Merkel among leaders subject to surveillance \u2013 report"}, {"date": "2013-12-03T17:34:00Z", "body": "The Guardian has come under concerted pressure and intimidation designed to stop it from publishing stories of huge public interest that have revealed the \"staggering\" scale of Britain's and America's secret surveillance programmes, the editor-in-chief of the newspaper has said. Giving evidence to a parliamentary committee about stories based on the National Security Agency leaks from the whistleblower Edward Snowden, Alan Rusbridger said the Guardian \"would not be put off by intimidation, but nor are we going to behave recklessly\". He told MPs that disclosures from the files had generated a global debate about the powers of state agencies, and the weaknesses of the laws and oversight regimes they worked within. \"In terms of the broader debate, I can't think of a story in recent times that has ricocheted around the world like this has and which has been more broadly debated in parliaments, in courts and amongst NGOs,\" he said. \"The roll call of people who have said there needs to be a debate about this includes three presidents of the United States, two vice-presidents, generals, the security chiefs in the US [who] are all saying this is a debate that in retrospect we had to have.\" During an hour-long session in front of the home affairs select committee, Rusbridger also: \u2022 Said the Guardian had consulted government officials and intelligence agencies \u2013 including the FBI, GCHQ, the White House and the Cabinet Office \u2013 on more than 100 occasions before the publication of stories. \u2022 Said the D-Notice committee, which flags the potential damage a story might cause to national security, had said that nothing published by the Guardian had put British lives at risk. \u2022 Argued that news organisations that had published stories from the Snowden files had performed a public service and highlighted the weakness of the scrutiny of agencies such as GCHQ and the NSA. \"It's self-evident,\" he said. \"If the president of the US calls a review of everything to do with this and that information only came to light via newspapers, then newspapers have done something oversight failed to do.\" \u2022 Asked why parliament had not demanded to know how 850,000 people had been given access to the GCHQ top-secret files taken by Snowden, who was a private security contractor.\nRusbridger said the Guardian had been put under the kind of pressure to stop publishing stories that would have been inconceivable in other countries. \"They include prior restraint, they include a senior Whitehall official coming to see me to say: 'There has been enough debate now'. They include asking for the destruction of our disks. They include MPs calling for the police to prosecute the editor. So there are things that are inconceivable in the US. \"I feel that some of this activity has been designed to intimidate the Guardian.\" In one curious exchange, the committee chair, Keith Vaz, asked Rusbridger if he loved his country. \"I'm slightly surprised to be asked the question,\" replied Rusbridger. \"But, yes, we are patriots and one of the things we are patriotic about is the nature of democracy, the nature of a free press and the fact that one can in this country discuss and report these things. \"One of the things I love about this country is that we have that freedom to write, and report, and to think and we have some privacy, and those are the concerns which need to be balanced against national security, which no one is underestimating. I can speak for the entire Guardian staff who live in this country that they want to be secure too.\" At one point, the MP Mark Reckless suggested a criminal offence had been committed by sharing some of the Snowden material with the New York Times. \"You have I think Mr Rusbridger admitted a criminal offence in your response. Do you consider that it would not be in the public interest for the CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] to prosecute?\" Rusbridger replied: \"I think it depends on your view of a free press.\" He said the Guardian had not lost control of any of the documents and the newspaper had used \"military-grade\" encryption to safeguard the files. \"No data was lost, we lost control of no data. No names have leaked from the Guardian.\" There was a testy set of exchanges between the editor and Michael Ellis. The Tory MP asked Rusbridger about stories in the Guardian that revealed GCHQ had a Pride group. Ellis claimed this had endangered the security of GCHQ staff. \"You've lost me,\" said Rusbridger. He said the details of the existence of the Pride group were publicly available on the internet. The Guardian has published a series of stories about the mass surveillance techniques of GCHQ and its US counterpart, the NSA, over the last six months; two of the most significant programmes uncovered in the Snowden files were Prism, run by the NSA, and Tempora, which was set up by GCHQ. Between them, they allow the agencies to harvest, store and analyse data about millions of phone calls, emails and search-engine queries. Rusbridger's answers referred to comments made to a parliamentary committee last month by the chiefs of Britain's three intelligence agencies \u2013 Sir Iain Lobban, the director of GCHQ, Andrew Parker, the director general of MI5, and Sir John Sawers, chief of MI6. The men had claimed that the Snowden revelations had damaged national security and that terrorists were likely rubbing their hands in glee. Asked about this, Rusbridger said: \"It is important context that the editors of probably the world's leading newspapers\u00a0\u2026 took virtually identical decisions. This is not a rogue newspaper. It is serious newspapers that have long experience of dealing with national security. \"The problem with these accusations is they tend to be very vague and not rooted in specific stories.\" Rusbridger then quoted senior officials from the UK and the US who \"have told me personally that there has been no damage. A member of the Senate intelligence committee said to us: 'I have been incredibly impressed by what you have done\u00a0\u2026 I have seen nothing that you have done that has caused damage.\" Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch, said: \"Newspapers around the world, from the Guardian to the Washington Post and Der Spiegel, have done what our own parliamentary oversight committee and other oversight bodies failed to do: they exposed unprecedented surveillance being undertaken without the knowledge or approval of our elected representatives. \"Spies spy, but they should not be able to write their own rules, exploiting woefully out-of-date legislation to collect information on millions of innocent people. \"If the three intelligence chiefs had previously faced anywhere near as rigorous cross-examination then perhaps we would not have been so dependent on the Guardian and other newspapers to learn just how out of control surveillance had become.\" Earlier today, the Watergate journalist and author, Carl Bernstein, wrote an open letter in which he said Rusbridger's appearance at the committee was \"dangerously pernicious\". Bernstein said it was an attempt by the \"highest UK authorities to shift the issue from government policies and excessive government secrecy in the United States and Great Britain to the conduct of the press\". \"You are being called to testify at a moment when governments in Washington and London seem intent on erecting the most serious (and self-serving) barriers against legitimate news reporting \u2013 especially of excessive government secrecy \u2013 we have seen in decades,\" Bernstein wrote. Yesterday the UN special raporteur on counter-terrorism and human rights, Ben Emmerson, announced he was launching an investigation into the surveillance programmes operated by GCHQ and the NSA. He said the Guardian and other media organisations reporting the Snowden revelations had disclosed matters of genuine public interest and concern to states across the globe. \"The astonishing suggestion that this sort of journalism can be equated with aiding and abetting terrorism needs to be scotched decisively,\" Emmerson said. \"Attacking the Guardian is an attempt to do the bidding of the services themselves, by distracting attention from the real issues.\"\n", "title": "Guardian will not be intimidated over NSA leaks, Alan Rusbridger tells MPs"}]
