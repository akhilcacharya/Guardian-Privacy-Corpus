# Notes 

Initial presentation was provided with an incorrect figure because of a spreadsheet error - this has been rectified. The percentage remaining went down from 8.5% to 2.1%, yielding about 5700 articles. This has been corrected in the copy of the slides that are in the shared folder and in the PRESENTATION/ folder in the repository.
